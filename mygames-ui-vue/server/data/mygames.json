Tiles are drawn and placed on squares on the board. As the tiles are placed islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, bases, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful discoverer of all. Completed islands yield victory points to all who have invested in exploration on an island, but of course the most points go to the player who has established the strongest presence.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Die Neuen Entdecker or Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In 2004, a smaller version of the Entdecker game was released, based on the online version available on the www.playcatan.de site.&#10;         Oceania.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In 2007, the game system was revamped in a new &quot;Entdecker&quot;-series of 3 titles (so far):&#10;         Im Reich der Jadegottin (published 2007)&#10;         Im Reich der W&#195;&#188;stensohne (published 2008)&#10;         Im Reich der D&auml;monen (not yet published)&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qXUTaJxFGRqX1G9hCHv_vQ__thumb/img/roUGcOtYQxZXvdZvZEnp5t_tFrM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic194144.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qXUTaJxFGRqX1G9hCHv_vQ__original/img/oJSgPjr_NK-mhNNduhd0PKs3H_E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic194144.jpg","yearpublished":"1996","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":10,"publishers":["999 Games","Goldsieber Spiele","Mayfair Games"],"designers":["Klaus Teuber"],"artists":["Andreas Steiner","Franz Vohwinkel"],"rating":6.42171,"weight":2.2468},
{"id":"201","name":"The Rose King","description":"Originally published as Texas by db-Spiele.&#10;&#10;The battle between farmers and ranchers is fairly abstract. A single pawn travels on a square grid. Each player has a hand of cards face up. These each have a direction and a distance. The player can either draw a card and add it to his hand, or play a card. If he plays a card, then the pawn moves the appropriate distance to an empty square, and the player places one of his markers. Each player also has judge symbols that can each be used only once. The judge lets you move onto a previously placed opposition marker and reverse it. Players score points for each contiguous region equal to the square of the number of markers. If a player is not careful, such a move may be forced, as there is a maximum number of cards that a player may hold.&#10;&#10;Contains rules for playing with 4 (in two partnerships of two players).&#10;&#10;Later republished 1999 as Rosenk&ouml;nig by Kosmos, as part of the two-player game series. The republication also included a re-theming of the game. The setting changed from Texas to England, and the factions changed from farmers and ranchers to the factions of the Plantagenet family from the Wars of the Roses (1455-1485) - the Lancaster (red rose) and the York (white rose) factions in a similarly abstracted fashion.&#10;&#10;Rosenk&ouml;nig is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vfFy_HLiBNLxptwxFDMmDg__thumb/img/CJ8yTQu3kt8o4ZwF5ZbMJWDj564=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2855891.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vfFy_HLiBNLxptwxFDMmDg__original/img/P3_WKEg4RBXmBWIVE4pMhFD35x4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2855891.jpg","yearpublished":"1992","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":2,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":10,"publishers":["db-Spiele","KOSMOS","999 Games","OPEN'N PLAY","Playte","Tilsit","White Goblin Games"],"designers":["Dirk Henn"],"artists":["Tanja Donner","Wanjin Gill","Anke Pohl","Thilo Rick","Andreas Steiner","Claus Stephan"],"rating":6.81514,"weight":1.9375},
{"id":"202","name":"Targui","description":"Conquer and occupy the valuable desert grounds. And also keep your home village! By tactically moving groups of camels through the different desert grounds and by using its specialties you can rule the desert. -- from the rulebook&#10;&#10;Targui has a board made of large square tiles representing the different types of desert ground. These provide varying economic and strategic value, from 0-5, and with a salt mine in the center, random distribution (with a little tinkering) makes a varied map each game. Players have a village tile which they place on the outer edge, and start with some camels and money. Your turn simply consists of moving and buying camels, expanding your control of the land.&#10;&#10;Targui has very simple mechanisms, and is in effect a simple rolling war game with obvious tactics. But the random turn order creates a wonderful world of rapidly shifting alliances, with players making and breaking promises within moments. The winner is not the one with most money or camels, but with the most economic value under their control.&#10;&#10;The game plays nicely with 3 or 4 players. However, Targui is a long game. Eight rounds takes about three hours, so using the whole deck of 20 fortune cards makes for an over-long game. If you enjoy Risk or light wargaming, then you'll get a lot from Targui.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M-VxCY-A19tuJBYPskqUXg__thumb/img/GvFIFUlvlduJnKTHsKMmd8YaiP8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1787067.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M-VxCY-A19tuJBYPskqUXg__original/img/dUzAoytfQL2k4ggnmRh0AKdYmqI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1787067.jpg","yearpublished":"1988","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":120,"maxplaytime":"120","minage":12,"publishers":["Jumbo"],"designers":["Wil Dijkstra","Ben van Dijk"],"artists":["Wil Dijkstra","Ben van Dijk"],"rating":6.40688,"weight":2.3871},

Based on the player count, you use 4-6 colors of cards ranging from 1-9 to 1-18.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, you receive 12 cards in hand, and you must place any peppers on the table in front of you. The lead player in a trick plays any card from their hand or one of their peppers. Each other player must follow suit, if possible, except that you are not forced to play the matching pepper card, should you have it. (However, if you do have it, you cannot play a pepper of another color to this trick.) Whoever plays the highest card in the suit led wins the trick and leads the next trick. If you win a pepper in a trick, place it on the table in front of you; you can play this pepper on a future trick, whether to lead off the trick or to play it on a trick that's already in progress.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has no cards in hand, the round ends. All players add any cards in hand to the cards in front of them, whether peppers or cards claimed in tricks. Each pepper you have is worth 2 points, and each card in the same suit as a pepper you have is worth 1 point.

{"id":"208","name":"Ex & Hopp","description":"A quick and simple card game for 2-6 milk-drinking players. Each player places a color card down as their marker and the matching sets of cards numbered 1-12 in those colors make up the deck. The deck is shuffled and players get 4 cards, the remainder goes down as a draw deck. There is a set of small tiles in red and black for negative or positive points (red are 4,4,5,5,6,6, black are 2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6). These are shuffled face down and 4 turned up to start 4 rows.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can place a card against a row or try to swap a card with another player. If you want to swap, you simply offer a color for another color, mentioning no numbers. Swap with the player of your choice, but if nobody wants to swap, you've wasted your turn.&#10;&#10;When you play a card to a row, you draw back so you have 4 cards. When the row is full, determined by the number on the tile, the player with the highest total in the cards has to take the tile, be it positive or negative. Usually your choices are obvious, but sometimes it is worth assisting another player to take a row, rather than waste a good card for you on a low or negative tile. If a row is tied between players, the cards are discarded and the tile stays for more cards.&#10;&#10;The discard deck is shuffled over, taken tiles refreshed by new ones. The game ends when the tiles are all taken, deduct the negative from the positive to get your score.&#10;&#10;This game was re-themed and expanded on with Relikt.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HXgMBa5EPFGn3xGfC7D00g__thumb/img/wIYqC45QECkTkiiHkzbKNoQ-g_Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic452085.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HXgMBa5EPFGn3xGfC7D00g__original/img/0JgWdO-Fv8Y9ObDtI9TTYTrHvac=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic452085.jpg","yearpublished":"1996","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":10,"publishers":["F.X.

It is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.&#10;&#10;The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.&#10;&#10;The last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses &mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call &quot;Tichu&quot; prior to playing any card. This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so, their team scores 100 points, and if not, their team instead loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call &quot;Grand Tichu&quot; after looking at only their first eight cards for a &plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).&#10;&#10;The first team to 1,000 points wins.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gz8_8iYP2SSGVAxpp7CwLg__thumb/img/5jkPnPGk5LWNzuW5GANPDLa4ZRA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5854968.png","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gz8_8iYP2SSGVAxpp7CwLg__original/img/9ULfNvkyu0k1m0d63-Mk0k5e0MA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5854968.png","yearpublished":"1991","minplayers":4,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":10,"publishers":["Fata Morgana Spiele","999 Games","ABACUSSPIELE","Filosofia √âditions","G3","GP Games","Hobby World","HomoLudicus","Korea Boardgames","Maldito Games","Playhouse Ltd","Rio Grande Games","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.","TIKI Editions","uplay.it edizioni","Venner√∏d Forlag AS"],"designers":["Urs Hostettler"],"artists":["Kerri Aitken","Christine Alcouffe","Res Brandenberger","Fran√ßois Bruel","Philippe Gu√©rin","Urs Hostettler","Chris Quilliams","Valerie Vekemans","Franz Vohwinkel"],"rating":7.57524,"weight":2.3405},

Heating your hotplate is a random affair with a die, and could raise the heat on everyone's plate. Spicing the dish is heart of the game and done by up-ending small bottles filled with little colored wood pellets.

{"id":"218","name":"High-Bid","description":"Players represent collectors attempting to gather sets of valuable properties and artifacts ... coins, antiques, miniatures, etc. These sets are worth handsome sums at game's end. Individual pieces of a set are worthless at game's end, but are able to be sold during the course of the game in order to provide a cash-flow.&#10;&#10;These 'properties' are represented on cards. There are 12 different types of properties, varying from 3 - 6 pieces per set. Naturally, the sets containing six pieces are much more valuable than the sets containing only three pieces as it is much more difficult to complete these larger sets.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt six cards and given a starting 'fund' of $2,000. The top 'property' card is revealed and a bidding ensues. The winner pays the bank and takes the card into his hand. The player then has the option of selling 1 - 3 properties to the bank. The idea here is to rid yourself of properties that you do not wish to collect and provide a source of income.&#10;&#10;There is danger, however. The sales price is determined randomly via the roll of two dice. The price can vary from 25% - 100% of the listed worth of the item. Further, if a '0' is rolled on one of the dice, then the item is NOT sold outright, but rather an auction takes place amongst the players. This can result in a substantially reduced price to the seller, or a higher price, depending upon the demand for the item. Further, it is quite possible that no one desires the item, so the seller must take the item back into his hand. There is also the possibility that the player will earn a $200 bonus if the proper digit is rolled on one of the dice.&#10;&#10;When a property is sold, it is placed on the appropriate section of the 'board' - 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (there really isn't a board, just a card holder that indicates these sections). After a player sells properties, he may surrender one of the special 'buyer' cards and purchase from 1 - 3 cards from one of these markets. The player must pay the indicated price (based on the particular percentage market where the property is located) and take the property into his hand.&#10;&#10;Again, there is a decision to be made here. Buyer cards are very valuable, as they can be used in a number of fashions:&#10;&#10;1) Purchase properties, as described above;&#10;&#10;2) Used as a 'wild' card to complete a set; or&#10;&#10;3) Valued as $500.00 at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;So, a player has to weigh the advantages of each of these options and play accordingly.&#10;&#10;Buyer cards are purchases at auction in conjunction with a property card. When a Buyer card is revealed, another card is then revealed, and both cards are then auctioned together. The auction is a 'sealed' auction, however, so the stakes are often high as these cards carry tremendous advantages.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion until the property deck expires or a player calls an end to the game. One can only do this, however, if he has a total value (property sets plus cash) in excess of $5,000. Even then, a player should only do this when he feels he has more assets than any of his opponents.&#10;&#10;As High Bid, this game was published for the 3M Bookshelf Series and 3M Gamette Series.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3tpXY0VnU3bu701E8cBPBg__thumb/img/sq22SbzA0EjkykKdwsymC0sYICo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic58613.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3tpXY0VnU3bu701E8cBPBg__original/img/qAxN_nRltuTQxciQK533xv5YFjE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic58613.jpg","yearpublished":"1963","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":25,"maxplaytime":"25","minage":12,"publishers":["3M","The Avalon Hill Game Co","Casper"],"designers":["Larry Winters","P.

{"id":"219","name":"Volle H√ºtte","description":"Players take on the role of club-owners vying for customers' Deutsch Marks in this unique board game, called Full House in German.&#10;&#10;Each player is given a small board representing their cafe or pub. In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) &amp; activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.&#10;&#10;When there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.&#10;&#10;This is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.&#10;&#10;So if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (&quot;Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool&quot;). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (&quot;This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!&quot;). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.&#10;&#10;And if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).&#10;&#10;There are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little. The game ends when the Action cards or the Billing cards are exhausted.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most money, having milked the punters as much as possible.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R7z-RyRJpbJpbJh_OSbu_g__thumb/img/Z65NzJre_5FYTxJU0SWFqwEs8iE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1300663.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R7z-RyRJpbJpbJh_OSbu_g__original/img/SvO00dRrnJUJLZQI8ESNOJ73iPw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1300663.jpg","yearpublished":"1997","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":12,"publishers":["ASS Altenburger Spielkarten"],"designers":["Stefan Dorra"],"artists":["Wilfried Gebhard"],"rating":6.17446,"weight":2.0909},

{"id":"221","name":"Ikusa","description":"Shogun / Samurai Swords is the last game in the original Milton Bradley Gamemaster series. It was later rereleased by HAH under the name Ikusa. The game focuses on the chaotic feudal society of Japan during the Middle Ages. Players play one of several factions that erupt into a civil war, trying to consolidate their strongholds and then defeat other armies for the right to be called Shogun, the supreme ruler.&#10;&#10;In the game, players command forces on islands of feudal Japan.  Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos.  In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round.  The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw.  Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja.  Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls.  A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell&#039;s Shogun. Ikusa is the latest iteration of the game.&#10;&#10;Winner of 1988 Origins Awards:&#10;&#10;     Best Pre-20th Century Board Game&#10;     Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game&#10;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fwG7yJFb4Py3ZGRNXHIYEw__thumb/img/QDGmr3zU-g0sjtCe_3WkQY7qP5o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1050037.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fwG7yJFb4Py3ZGRNXHIYEw__original/img/To7hx1UUqgDS271spiodHss2Lkw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1050037.jpg","yearpublished":"1986","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":240,"maxplaytime":"360","minage":12,"publishers":["Milton Bradley","Avalon Hill","Wizards of the Coast"],"designers":["Michael Gray"],"artists":["Steve Argyle"],"rating":7.03013,"weight":2.9544},
{"id":"222","name":"Space Beans","description":"This game is a successor to the popular Bohnanza but is less complex and is not based on trading.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to collect 30 points in &quot;trophies&quot; to win the game. This is accomplished by working with up to two collections of space beans - 1 public (face-up) and 1 secret (face-down).&#10;&#10;The primary mechanic is drawing beans, placing them in one of your collections (public or secret) if you have any matching cards to play, then passing your entire hand to the player on your right. If you compile a collection that contains a number of beans equal to the number value on one of beans in the collection, you may redeem the collection for the same amount of points on that card.&#10;&#10;For example: If a player has three violet beans, and one of them has a value of 3, that collection can be converted for three trophy points.

{"id":"224","name":"History of the World","description":"History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear.  The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.&#10;&#10;Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.  Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.&#10;&#10;At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.&#10;&#10;Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.&#10;&#10;After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).&#10;&#10;After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2pr-83ghWQUlwXSLuSTCtw__thumb/img/4XPSkcdNf6CXGWsDGSRXrP7VUBc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic287451.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2pr-83ghWQUlwXSLuSTCtw__original/img/_MRG_pnmZQwScJWus84gwaXNflE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic287451.jpg","yearpublished":"1991","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":135,"maxplaytime":"270","minage":12,"publishers":["Avalon Hill","Ragnar Brothers","The Avalon Hill Game Co","Compendium Games","Gibsons","Welt der Spiele","Z-Man Games"],"designers":["Gary Dicken","Steve Kendall","Phil Kendall"],"artists":["Charles S.

{"id":"230","name":"Merchant of Venus","description":"Merchant of Venus makes players take on the roles of space traders chasing wealth and fortune. Each player moves their ship through interconnected systems on a fixed map, discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities, their earnings can be used to purchase equipment and construct their own infrastructure. The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement. When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities. Different species are randomly distributed throughout the universe at the start of the game, and players will only uncover which species lives where through exploration in the course of the game - the layout of which species lives where works to offset the rigidity of the fixed map by making different routes through the map profitable each game.&#10;&#10;The prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supply-and-demand mechanism. With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines).&#10;&#10;Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FZ7aD_jdYDqpcSBQ1rkT8A__thumb/img/P8HOlVIvm5Kj1vBCB35WMU0y77s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic159117.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FZ7aD_jdYDqpcSBQ1rkT8A__original/img/DRiPQCym-5XtuaO6hswEoGzcKkY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic159117.jpg","yearpublished":"1988","minplayers":1,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":180,"maxplaytime":"180","minage":12,"publishers":["The Avalon Hill Game Co"],"designers":["Richard Hamblen"],"artists":["Charles Kibler","George I.

{"id":"231","name":"Geronimo","description":"The U.S. - Indian conflicts, a tragic period of history.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players are randomly assigned a side to play -- either Indian tribes or the U.S. Only one player represents the U.S. each turn, while the other players each have a number of Indian tribes under their control. Indian players get to select one or two of their active tribes, but the rest are dealt to them randomly. There are usually more Indian tribes available than what are active each turn, but players don't really know which ones are inactive.  This can be unsettling to the U.S. player as he must decide where to deploy his limited troops and columns.&#10;&#10;All players compete to earn victory points.  The U.S. player is faced with the task of building up sufficient resources (settlements, towns, railroads, mines, etc.) to maintain existing states and convert territories into states. The Indian players play the role of guerrillas to earn victory points, but also can deny resources to the U.S. player. However, he must be very careful not to suffer too many casualties, as this could cause his tribe to go on reservation or become extinct, which costs the player dearly in victory points.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KmV2KFHes6VnFEZxdL7jLA__thumb/img/PrC1ytSjJevtVqfHGhcae2rspzM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic87910.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KmV2KFHes6VnFEZxdL7jLA__original/img/WaQFRHAgRoOqL_r1SGs2SycGd44=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic87910.jpg","yearpublished":"1995","minplayers":1,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":480,"maxplaytime":"480","minage":12,"publishers":["The Avalon Hill Game Co"],"designers":["Richard H.

{"id":"232","name":"Serenissima","description":"The Theme&#10;&#10;In the fourteenth century, the Atlantic was an ocean without end and America was yet to be discovered. The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.&#10;&#10;Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.&#10;&#10;In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered &quot;full&quot;), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.&#10;&#10;The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JDu-gDsxSSL49NPK7tfipg__thumb/img/9N_wI7AtLR1qsSEq2MZI18nAA9Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic322925.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JDu-gDsxSSL49NPK7tfipg__original/img/3q8CAGuSM98IZ1p4bfAtF2tIx9s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic322925.jpg","yearpublished":"1996","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":120,"maxplaytime":"120","minage":12,"publishers":["Descartes Editeur","Eurogames","999 Games"],"designers":["Dominique Ehrhard","Duccio Vitale"],"artists":["Dominique Ehrhard","Guillaume Rohmer","Duccio Vitale"],"rating":6.85121,"weight":3.0347},

{"id":"235","name":"Blackbeard","description":"Introduction (from the rule book):&#10;&#10;BLACKBEARD recreates &quot;The Golden Age of Piracy&quot; at the turn of the 18th century. Each player becomes one or more pirates and attempts to amass a fortune and retire before a King's Commissioner tracks him down, a Warship stumbles across him, or his own crew cuts his throat! Merchant ships plying the trade routes are the targets. Prizes range from near-worthless supplies to the fabulous Spanish and Mogul treasure ships. Luck, skill and cunning all play a part as you comb the Seven Seas (well ... at least three of them) for fame and fortune. Players should be aware that the game simulates 18th century piracy and therefore features random happenstance. Little can be planned. Players who are ready to strike when opportunity presents itself and are wily and aggressive without being rash will fare best in the long run.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players take up the roles of famous pirates navigating the major sea lanes during the golden age of piracy.  Plunder and pirateering await as each player moves about on the map in a variable system through a deck of cards.  Rather than the normal turn order in games, players move when their designation is drawn in a deck.  When not in the role of their pirate they can take on the role of one of the English military ships hunting the sea for pirates.  By making shrewd choices and having some luck the player can end the game a wealthy and retired pirate with a large fleet of ships that have been accumulated over the years.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3PPn_TiMX_kn75HoMBOYg__thumb/img/ZTPtOO0-y0Wa-0wUmYdxNI6UeAQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic164665.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3PPn_TiMX_kn75HoMBOYg__original/img/qJfpzHF1BaPbby16-q1dPEiSvLM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic164665.jpg","yearpublished":"1991","minplayers":1,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":120,"maxplaytime":"240","minage":12,"publishers":["The Avalon Hill Game Co","Descartes Editeur"],"designers":["Richard H.

Each game turn has between 7 and 9 rounds, drawing cards, President assigns roles, foreign aid money is drawn, the president proposes a budget which is voted on, locations are chosen, there are assassination attempts, then the bank may be open or not, there may be a coup and aftermath, then the next round starts. The game is won by whoever has the most pesos in their Swiss bank account when the money runs out.&#10;&#10;The game is for 4 to 7 players (although there are 2 and 3 player variants).  A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.&#10;&#10;Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round. Players assassinated or killed simply become another member of their family and begin again with new cards, but keeping any of their family's funds deposited in their Swiss bank account.&#10;&#10;If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over. At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President.

Game takes about 10 minutes to learn and 1-2 hours to play, high solitaire playability.  The rules are as simple as possible. Units have Zones of control, which cannot be exited. When in enemy ZOC, combat is mandatory. Units may advance after combat. Retreats through ZOCs are forbidden, so you need to surround the enemy to eliminate him. Artillery may fire two hexes away (and not suffer from adverse results). Cavalry units are just faster and weaker infantry units .  There are two scenarios.  The historical one pictures Napoleon in Jena, outnumbering the Prussians, and Davout in Auerstadt, outnumbered by other Prussians. ). To win, you have to eliminate as many enemy units as possible at the end of the game (thus demoralizing the enemy).  The second &quot;what-if&quot; scenario assumes that all the Prussians have been sent to Jena, for the decisive battle. Davout will enter as reinforcement, on the flank/back of the Prussians, but in the end of the game.

He follows that up by playing a unit, either German or Allied, that was available in the chosen year and could fight in the chosen environment, and the other players subsequently either pass or play a unit (of either nationality) that meets the same conditions.  When all players have made their selections, dice (sometimes) are rolled and totals are compared to determine whether the Germans or the Allies won.  The player who contributed the most to the winning team gets to decide how the convoy and the opposing enemy ships, which are all worth victory points and possibly an increased hand size, are to be distributed amongst the players who were on the winning side.  After twenty convoys have been fought over in this manner, the player with the most victory points' worth of convoys and captured ships wins the game!&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pacific Typhoon&#10;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Tm-a-L5RL_qHz49-VGN53A__thumb/img/q2VvajyZkK8PGeMBEvCUrwoQdQQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic130606.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Tm-a-L5RL_qHz49-VGN53A__original/img/5-iKrialCrygjMdxNvfKGOO9NL8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic130606.jpg","yearpublished":"1997","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":10,"publishers":["The Avalon Hill Game Co"],"designers":["Don Greenwood","Ben Knight"],"artists":["Mark Forrer","Tyson Milbert","Kurt Miller","Dave Shaw (II)"],"rating":6.54456,"weight":2.0508},

{"id":"267","name":"Tycoon","description":"In Tycoon, players are businessmen traveling around the world, doing what businessmen do: making money.  In this case, business is defined as opening hotels and factories in major cities, like Sydney, Cairo, and New York.&#10;&#10;Players are seeking to build hotels in as many cities as possible while also building the first or second most hotels in given cites to earn money, which is also your score. Additional money can be earned by building factories in each city, but these are limited in number.&#10;&#10;During the course of the game players will take turns buying and/or using plane tickets to move about the board's nine cities. A number of tickets are displayed in rows, divided into two types: The more expensive scheduled flights which allow you to move directly to the printed city, or move your token a number of city spaces orthogonally on the board. Cheaper charter flights allow movement directly between the two city spaces printed on the ticket. You may buy tickets at any time during your turn, and you are not required to move but must do so before taking any regular actions; you may also use any many tickets in a turn as you wish.&#10;&#10;The regular actions include building hotels and factories. Hotels are built on a u-shaped track. When a hotel is built on a red space the building that is oldest/furthest back on the track is removed. Players with the first and second most hotels on the track will be the only ones to score, with ties broken by the player with the earliest bulding on the track. There are only two factory spaces per city, and they will score points equal to the second place of the hotel scoring. In lieu of any actions or flying, or if you simply have no money, you may also take out loans; this removes your token from the board and forces you to use the more costly scheduled flights to return to the board.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game players are given all of their factories. Each round players are given a set number of hotels in addition to any they have left over from the previous round. When any player has built all of the hotels in front of them a scoring occurs. After three scorings the game ends and the player with the most money is the winner.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/auu_P7W6rlXjVWJMR1hnpQ__thumb/img/3SkSTq65qqOU_76oVfbjptEYDic=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic102645.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/auu_P7W6rlXjVWJMR1hnpQ__original/img/AS8hbkJUOw6EsH7W3L12JDazpD0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic102645.jpg","yearpublished":"1998","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":90,"maxplaytime":"90","minage":10,"publishers":["Jumbo"],"designers":["Wolfgang Kramer","Horst-Rainer R√∂sner"],"artists":[],"rating":6.75611,"weight":2.6375},

Status is achieved by accumulating fiefs, money, history cards in sets (which include such things as Queens, scientists, cultural personalities, palaces, commanders, etc.), troops and merchants.&#10;&#10;The game is driven by event cards ... and there are a ton of 'em.

Three to six players vie for control of the government as rebels wage a civil war against those in power. As in real guerrilla warfare, the government forces are handicapped by their inability to separate friend from foe. This &quot;fog of war&quot; is accomplished by a clever dichotomy of goals wherein each player simultaneously commands both government and rebel forces. However, each player is secretly backing either the government of rebel cause and is severely penalized if his &quot;side&quot; doesn't win the hand.&#10;&#10;Consequently, players are always torn between scoring for their &quot;side&quot;, or for themselves, or even sacrificing their own resources for the sake of an opponent who appears to be on their side. But is he? Even when you think you've figured out who is who, the Revolution card can appear to change loyalties and totally cloud the issue again.&#10;&#10;Players score by eliminating opposing forces, manipulating the media and world opinion, or controlling various installations such as the Port or Airfield which grant special abilities to those who hold them. Government air power and armor columns struggle against ambushing guerrilla bands which fade back into the jungle without a trace. If atrocities are committed, the U.N. may intervene and attempt to stop the open warfare. Then the battle is fought by secret police who ferret out traitors while propaganda battles are waged for the hearts and minds of the populace.

{"id":"276","name":"La Guerre de l'Empereur: The Emperor's War, 1805-1815","description":"La Guerre de l'Empereur: The Emperor's War, 1805-1815 is a game of maneuver and battle between the forces under Napoleon Bonaparte and six other nations that both opposed and supported him at various times in the years between 1805 and 1815. Players vie for dominance of early 19th Century Europe. As the French player, you'll set Napoleon and his armies upon a continent whose differing political statures plays right into your hands. The greatest army in Europe is at your hands...&#10;&#10;Divide and conquer! As the British player, you'll utilize diplomacy, clever event play, a powerhouse economy and the greatest navy in the world to become the dominant nation. As Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain or the Ottoman Empire, you must strike a balance between expansionist aggression and diplomatic harmony among your neighbors. Indeed, a nation must expand to triumph. However the means chosen to that end will largely decide the level of success. Play  the part of being everyone's friend and your nation will likely live in relative safety...and lose the game miserably. Play the part of the blind aggressor and you'll likely go down faster than the peace broker. Striking a balance is critical.&#10;&#10;The game map covers the territories from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean and North Africa in the south, and from deep Russia in the east to Portugal and the Atlantic in the west. Movement is by areas (provinces) on land, and sea zones at sea. On land, the units of maneuver are (roughly) corps, while at sea each unit represents a naval squadron. When opposing land armies meet for battle, corps are broken down into divisions (loosely) and deployed on a eight zone battle map for combat resolution. The dice-less combat engine uses a system of battle options which are played and cross-referenced for resolution of actual casualties and morale loss. The number of battle options distributed, along with the initial army morale of the opposing sides, is determined by army size, nationality and leaders present. The battle options are of offensive and defensive nature. The offensive options cover standard maneuvers such as &quot;Flank Attack&quot;, &quot;Cavalry Charge&quot; and &quot;Assault&quot;, while the defensive options are things such as &quot;Refuse Flanks&quot;, &quot;Squares Formed&quot; and &quot;Reverse Slopes&quot;.&#10;&#10;The rules are relatively simple and fast moving, even though a host of subtleties and complexities of the Napoleonic period are represented within the game system. The means by which this relative simplicity was achieved was (largely) through the use of self-explanatory strategic event charts. Be warned: This game is easy to understand and play, but very difficult to master.&#10;&#10;The game system works the same whether you're playing with two players or seven. With multiple players, you'll need all of your diplomacy skills to enlist aid in achieving your goals. With fewer players, the event charts will handle the bulk of the diplomatic duties. Regardless of how many players you have, all seven major powers will actively participate to a greater or lesser degree.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xUhRmZLFxRY8k6StocpI0Q__thumb/img/h477qBpPphksiky4v0-QocVGwrM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic16960.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xUhRmZLFxRY8k6StocpI0Q__original/img/JLL6y7Hxi1eaJOjru376-i4KyiQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic16960.jpg","yearpublished":"1997","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":7,"minplaytime":240,"maxplaytime":"240","minage":12,"publishers":["OSG (Operational Studies Group)"],"designers":["Nicolas Pilartz","Kevin Zucker"],"artists":["Christopher Moeller"],"rating":6.4589,"weight":3.3846},

There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.&#10;&#10;When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),&#10;     a bonus resource,&#10;     an attack if a player has too many resources, and&#10;     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     &#10;&#10;&#10;There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns.

{"id":"280","name":"Neue Spiele im alten Rom","description":"Neue Spiele im Alten Rom (or New Games in Old Rome (NGIOR)) is a compendium of games from Reiner Knizia. In the box are fourteen games themed on ancient Rome. The games are themed to cover, albeit in a highly abstract fashion, the rise of Rome, the Roman Republic and finally, the Empire.&#10;&#10;(7 of the games are described below)&#10;&#10;The Wheel of History : 2-5 players&#10;&#10;This is an early version of what was to become Bunte Runde. 25 cards are laid out in a large circle, representing the tribes to be united under early Rome. Players may advance a pawn one, two or three spaces forwards and collect a card. Cards are scored on face value, but there are some quirks that vary this.&#10;&#10;The Seven Hills of Rome : 2 players&#10;&#10;This is one of the easier games in the compendium. The theme here is you are battling your opponent for control of the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented by seven cards, numbered 1 to 7, laid out between the players. Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;Mercator : 3-7 players&#10;&#10;This game is Medici&#039;s ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.&#10;&#10;Imperium : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;The aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.&#10;&#10;Senator : 2-3 players&#10;&#10;You play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.&#10;&#10;Circus Maximus : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;A simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.&#10;&#10;Consul : 2-4 players&#10;&#10;This is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both. The value of the set must equal of exceed the bid made, simply by summing the face values of the cards. If a mistake is made, the cards are turned face down, and the player must discard a card from their hand into the grid. If the bid is made, the cards are taken into the players hand. At the end of the game, the highest total held wins.&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Translated rulebook to the contrary, this game has never been published by an English publisher.&#10;&#10;Note: 3 of these have been printed/repackaged in English by GMT in Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RZLGiBTl77_DD05IcMLwKA__thumb/img/UOWQScUI33EgZDN3O_66oWDHB9M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5886.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RZLGiBTl77_DD05IcMLwKA__original/img/Y18nWSmrSQtQ2G6JhOq63ZQw3I8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5886.jpg","yearpublished":"1994","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":7,"minplaytime":20,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":10,"publishers":["New Games Order, LLC","Piatnik"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"artists":["Franz Vohwinkel"],"rating":6.83329,"weight":2.3333},

{"id":"289","name":"Chariot Lords","description":"Between 1500 and 600 BC, Asia Minor and the Mediterranean witnessed the rise and fall of several mighty empires. Often the birth of one empire precipitated the death of another. How could a small people like the Judeans establish an empire when located between such giants as Egypt and Assyria? Why did some Empires endure for centuries while others lasted only a few generations? Chariot Lords shows you the how and why.&#10;&#10;Each Lord controls between 5 and 6 nations, some strong, others weak, each with varying goals and objectives - indeed some of these countries may not even exist at the same time. Players compete against one another to achieve the victory criteria for their empires. Nations quickly become rivals, involving them in death struggles over expansion. Each turn (90 years) will see new countries come to the fore, while established empires struggle to levy reinforcements and arrange alliances. A fine line must be walked between conserving one's forces and expanding one's empire. Too much expansion will see your resources spread thin and possibly swept away by a new emerging empire, but not enough aggression will see your empire fail to garner sufficient victory points to win.&#10;&#10;Armies are of a mix of foot and mounted units, along with the occasional leader of note. It is not enough to conquer -- you must be able to keep what you have taken. The winner will be the one who has the most victory points after all the armies have had their moment on the stage. It is up to you to determine whether your empire will be relegated to the dustbin of history, or whether others will hail you as...The Chariot Lord.&#10;&#10;Contents: &#10;&#10;    8 pages of Rules, 4 of notes and commentary &#10;    1 hard-backed map &#10;    140 3/4 inch square counters/markers &#10;    170 5/8 inch square counters &#10;    4 victory point charts with combat charts on reverse &#10;    4 nation force arrival charts &#10;    1 master nation force arrival chart&#10;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lNaJapx0qSHzHHVB6Ee3MQ__thumb/img/3QB9yRKu_WlC3RwE6Ckcv9qTpIc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic64656.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lNaJapx0qSHzHHVB6Ee3MQ__original/img/LhxNowLaXNZQNs0IZzKh9VfzgtM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic64656.jpg","yearpublished":"1999","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":360,"maxplaytime":"360","minage":12,"publishers":["Clash of Arms Games","Tilsit"],"designers":["Charles Vasey"],"artists":["Greg Cervall"],"rating":6.69094,"weight":2.75},

At the end of each turn an event card takes effect, giving points to officeholders, allowing free building, or causing some other occurrence.  Layed out around the board during game setup, these event cards are revealed to allow players to see the upcoming three events.  When all the event cards have taken effect, players score points for their neighborhoods and for occupying high offices.   The player with the most points takes the day.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UVMjgA0XI47E4OGrE1GPUg__thumb/img/kttl2oKQ81F2Bzk8YNFMOm6Aa1E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7741066.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UVMjgA0XI47E4OGrE1GPUg__original/img/_zSDHc6C-IjoCdybW4JqNg1x_bA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7741066.jpg","yearpublished":"1998","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":120,"maxplaytime":"120","minage":9,"publishers":["Casper","Target Games"],"designers":["Dan Glimne"],"artists":["Per Gullarp"],"rating":5.27677,"weight":2.3},

{"id":"300","name":"Tutankhamen","description":"There are 69 artifact tiles in the game of Tutanchamun. These are shuffled and then laid out randomly in a long, serpentine trail. Players take turns choosing any tile from the trail, but can never turn back to choose a tile they have already passed. There are 15 different sets of tiles (three sets each of 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1), and when the last tile of any set has been claimed, the player holding the most in that set scores that number of points, while the player holding second most scores half that number. Complicating matters, there are also three tie-breaker tiles and three tiles that let you &quot;buy&quot; a tile from another player. It's an exercise in numbers that plays quickly, probably 30 minutes tops, and is suitable for youngsters yet susceptible to analysis. The game has a unique layout and a brightly-colored Egyptian pharaoh look.

{"id":"301","name":"Campanile","description":"Very nice combination of tile placement and betting. Players lay long tiles to build 5 towers taller and taller, whilst betting on which will be the tallest to shortest. The trick is that when you lay a tile to raise a tower one, two or three stories tall, this controls how much you can bet (1,2 or 3 tokens) and crucially, which draw pile you take from (pile 1, 2 or 3). Since the draw piles are face-up, I might want to draw from pile 3 to get a tile which will boost a tower I've bet on, but that means I have to lay a card three stories, and so I might have to play a tile from my hand that helps the other players! A very nice mechanism which gives those simple, frustrating choices we all enjoy. The scoring gives points to the first and second majority backers on each tower.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uX11J2JenL9xTl4v7H0UJQ__thumb/img/KiAdxffTQGrd2DfUdljDhe-IZps=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic578060.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uX11J2JenL9xTl4v7H0UJQ__original/img/L1_NUjgsMqWqoW8Pfr5M0GDmJkQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic578060.jpg","yearpublished":"1996","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":10,"publishers":["Blatz","DDD Verlag GmbH"],"designers":["Hanno Kuhn","Wilfried Kuhn"],"artists":["Angus Gray-Burbridge","Katharina Kubisch"],"rating":6.16814,"weight":1.6765},

{"id":"304","name":"Evergreen","description":"Combination of card play and timing from Wolfgang Kramer &amp; Michael Kiesling. There are some recording artists who are famous for singing certain standards. Players are putting on concerts and use numbered cards for each performer to take control of that singer. The singers are represented by old fashioned 45s, with a disc in the center showing values from 5 to 12. Each time a singer is transferred from control of one player to another, the disc is rotated, so the value can rise to 12, but next move, it drops to 5 again. You try to gain control of an artist at high value, or pass artists from one player to another to make them devalue. Scoring occurs when players choose to put on concerts at the end of their turn, including a gala show which doubles the value. The game rules state that the designers produced this game by phone and fax, without ever meeting. Perhaps that shows, as it has interest, but the game uses a sand-timer to apply pressure to your decisions.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c2YSJMFla14odVrI7SGSig__thumb/img/K7PPOzOmQ3UXjOy6n3SWyaCLyt0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic46308.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c2YSJMFla14odVrI7SGSig__original/img/z4BuXRTGEpqRCWUdouHPQYHDcVs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic46308.jpg","yearpublished":"1999","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":20,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":12,"publishers":["Goldsieber Spiele","Rio Grande Games"],"designers":["Michael Kiesling","Wolfgang Kramer"],"artists":["Franz Vohwinkel"],"rating":5.54669,"weight":1.8571},
{"id":"305","name":"Der Fliegende Holl√§nder","description":"Early Klaus Teuber game with a well deserved reputation, from a publisher better known for electronic games! The odd combination of mechanisms is a bit tricky to grasp at first, but soon reveals a nice contest. There are various ships in different colors marked on the board and players are dealt 3 random cards to show a share in three of the ships. Also on the board are treasure chests with rising values, and colored markers for each ship move from chest to chest, showing the worth of that vessel. Players begin with cash, 3 Smithy &amp; 3 Trade card, and some lucky horseshoes that they keep on a rack hidden from the other players. These are variously numbered and two dice are rolled at each turn to provide the lucky number.&#10;&#10;As the Flying Dutchman sails the seven seas, it can either move onto islands or the ships. If it is moved onto a ship, players reveal if they are share holders and pay the current value back to the bank as its marker is moved down to zero. On your turn, you can opt to use your Trade card to exchange 2 of your share cards, effectively dodging the Dutchman's threat. Or you can play a Smithy card, to allow you to take horseshoes at the end of the turn. But mainly you can attempt to control the Dutchman's move, by secretly laying down horseshoes to match the lucky number, the closest winning control. A nice rule, if there's a tie, the players are meant to try to agree, then barter, and finally compete with more horseshoes (all to the benefit of the Smithy card players!). Played horseshoes are pooled until Smithies divy them up.&#10;&#10;If the Dutchman is moved to an island, the controlling players reveal a share card and take the value of that ship from the bank. The round ends with all the chest markers moving up once, including a black marker, which ends the game when it reaches the highest chest. Players reveal their share cards and take the final value on the chests, most money wins.&#10;&#10;Puzzling to begin with, but you quickly realize whether your shares are under threat from a Dutchman's move, so you either trade out or try to gain control. If you're not under threat, it may be worth use your Smithy to grab the pool of horseshoes. Get your timing right and the whole thing becomes very rewarding. Simple choices, not perfectly balanced, but the players at times co-operate or struggle, making for an entertaining voyage.&#10;&#10;Winner of the 1992 Deutscher Spiele Preis.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x5JRP9Y_BaG-4vq2PJw-Dw__thumb/img/NO7cG5U2VP8LBYtfIBYlKNrMBgs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2042135.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x5JRP9Y_BaG-4vq2PJw-Dw__original/img/UFnpyTSbXhJ0AatoFc0t3er9d5E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2042135.jpg","yearpublished":"1992","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":12,"publishers":["Bandai Co., Ltd.","Huki","New Games Order, LLC","Parker Brothers","Parker Spiele"],"designers":["Klaus Teuber"],"artists":["Yusuke Mamada","Franz Vohwinkel"],"rating":6.06737,"weight":2.4762},

{"id":"308","name":"Santa Fe","description":"Each game is made up of rounds. A round begins with all players playing one card from their hands and placing it face down on the table. Then, all cards are exposed simultaneously.&#10;&#10;There are 66 City Cards and each carry a name of a city along with a number value (ranging from 2 to 7). Since the trains begin their expansion from the easternmost part of the board, the farther west the city, the higher its number value. Players score points only for City Cards that are played and placed face up. Cards that remain unplayed in hands have no value. The numerical value of a City Card is multiplied by the number of railroads connected to it.&#10;&#10;Players may also play a Double turn Card, a combination of a City Card with a Branch Line card or a combination of a Double Turn Card and a Branch Line Card.&#10;&#10;A Double Turn Card allows a player to place two pieces of track in both track phases of a turn (although only one piece of track may be placed if desired). Furthermore, all bonuses are doubled during the round that card is played.&#10;&#10;Each Railroad has two Branch Line Cards and a player may pay $1 and draw one of them. (Players may only hold one Branch Line Card in their hands at any one time.) If held, the Branch Line Card must be played immediately on the next round in conjunction with either a City or Double Turn Card.&#10;&#10;Play of a Branch Line Card allows a player to start a new route of track for the named railroad from any city that railroad connects, thereby extending the railroad.&#10;&#10;After exposing a card, the round continues with two turns of laying track. Players do not control any specific rail line. Each player can place track on any color provided that the played track connects to an existing corresponding rail network on the board. Once all track is placed, all players replenish their hands (up to five cards). The First Player passes the First Player Train to the player on the left (who becomes the First Player for the subsequent round) and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;The first player to connect the first railroad to any city earns $2. Certain cities are marked with colored squares (matching the colors of certain railroads). Should a corresponding color railroad enter that city, the player making that connection gets a bonus of $4. Double Turn Cards double all bonuses in a round.&#10;&#10;When all track pieces of all the railroads have been played or if a player is unable to play any piece of track because all playable railroads are &quot;dead-ended&quot;, the game ends and points are tallied.&#10;&#10;Points are received in two ways. First, players receive 1 point for each $1 they have. Second, each City Card is worth its value times the number of different rail lines connected to it. The player with the highest total wins! (In case of a tie, the player with the most City Cards valued at &quot;7&quot; is declared the victor.)&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XQahp_hq0Zgxq6wQE0zFNQ__thumb/img/yedKoVeSmjvLS_Br8618qRdNQ4o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic86174.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XQahp_hq0Zgxq6wQE0zFNQ__original/img/PmebyL0zbQ8iFM_oc5ihpIxplOo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic86174.jpg","yearpublished":"1992","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":70,"maxplaytime":"70","minage":10,"publishers":["White Wind"],"designers":["Alan R.

The main differences between the two games include the three dimensional aspect of Big Boss, and the existence of a strong monetary incentive to expand companies that you do not control.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/88O6qyRRVOvWL9f7dh2_Pw__thumb/img/CT9oXELT2sVntXBR22HwA0Csr1w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7468155.png","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/88O6qyRRVOvWL9f7dh2_Pw__original/img/Q8Zw7o-B8JqikHEdYe1yUuHZOPI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7468155.png","yearpublished":"1994","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":90,"maxplaytime":"90","minage":10,"publishers":["KOSMOS","Funko Games"],"designers":["Wolfgang Kramer"],"artists":["Migy Blanco","Wolfgang Kramer","Franz Vohwinkel"],"rating":7.24145,"weight":2.375},
{"id":"314","name":"Highlanders","description":"Rheingold is basically a Castle Risk-style game without the dice combat. The board depicts, rather fetchingly, eighteen castles on or near the Rhine. These are given point values depending on their size or importance, ranging between 1 and 3. The castles are linked to numerous movement areas by tracks meaning that some of the castles are in powerful positions (especially those providing or guarding a river bridge) and others are stuck out on a limb. At the start of the game, the castles aren't owned by anyone and the winner of the game is the one with the most points of captured castles at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/D3xiUv-zGLKwEU3FuhOo-Q__thumb/img/M-GDQ6Uqrip58JP-qmDexHaNDeE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3999.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/D3xiUv-zGLKwEU3FuhOo-Q__original/img/g8sHof9jcDgDCx8jJD1LO7Prfgs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3999.jpg","yearpublished":"1993","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":90,"maxplaytime":"90","minage":12,"publishers":["Jumbo","Soppol"],"designers":["Reinhard Herbert"],"artists":[],"rating":6.1844,"weight":2},
{"id":"315","name":"Bagh Chal","description":"Bagh Chal is a traditional abstract game that is popular in Nepal. The name roughly translates to &quot;Tigers Moving&quot;. It is an abstract strategy game with an asymmetric setup, i.e. a different number of pieces per side (like Hnefatafl and its ilk). One opponent plays four tiger pieces and the other plays twenty goats.&#10;&#10;The board bears a passing resemblance to a Chinese Chess board in that the pieces move along lines from intersection to intersection. However, the gameplay is more similar to Alquerque, Checkers or Draughts. At the start of the game, there are four tigers on the board while there are no goats. The goat player places his/her pieces on the board one by one wherever they choose, with the tiger player getting a move between each placing. Once all the goats are on the board, the two players take turns moving one of their pieces one space. A tiger can alternatively capture a single goat by jumping over it in a line  to an empty space. The tigers win if they can capture five goats. The goal for the goats (who cannot make captures) is to hem the tigers in, giving them no opportunity to move or jump.&#10;&#10;It is one variant from a family of similar Asian games played with varying numbers of tigers/leopards/goats/cows/etc and varying board topologies.&#10;See also Cows and Leopards and Fox and Geese.&#10;&#10;Games played on exactly the same board layout (same lines connecting the intersections and same size) include the traditional Spanish Alquerque and Fanoron-Dimy, the smaller variant of Fanorona from Madagascar.

{"id":"316","name":"Chase","description":"Each player starts Chase with a row of nine dice on their side of the hexagonal game board, with the faces of those d6s adding up to 25. On a turn, a player moves a die as many spaces in a straight line as the value showing on the die's face. A die can't move through another piece, but it can wrap around the side of the board and it can bounce off the front or back wall at an angle to move its full distance.&#10;&#10;If you land a die on an opponent's die, that second die is removed and the value of that die added to the lowest die on the opponent's team, keeping their pip count at 25. (If a die reaches 6, you add any remaining speed to what is now the lowest die.) If you land on one of your own dice, you bump that die one space in the same direction, possibly leading to another bump or a capture.&#10;&#10;Instead of moving, if you have two dice next to one another, you can spend the turn adjusting their values while keeping their sum the same. If, for example, you have a 2 and 5 adjacent to one another, you can change them to 1 &amp; 6, 3 &amp; 4, 4 &amp; 3, 5 &amp; 2, or 6 &amp; 1.&#10;&#10;The center of the board has a chamber on it. You cannot move a die through the chamber. If you land a die on the chamber, you split the value of that die on two dice as evenly as possible. (You start the game with one spare.) Those dice emerge from the chamber on spaces adjacent to it, possibly resulting in bumps or captures.&#10;&#10;If you knock an opponent down to only four dice, then they have a pip count below 25 and they lose the game.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FQmiPHFfyXg7_AvPkzsEDA__thumb/img/AAX4cxeZJnrTrtoEnAKzhC6E8Nk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic19452.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FQmiPHFfyXg7_AvPkzsEDA__original/img/jfyxMUaiSWk2-8rD9pSjoxQCOVk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic19452.jpg","yearpublished":"1985","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":2,"minplaytime":45,"maxplaytime":"45","minage":10,"publishers":["Blue Dolphin Games","Laurin Verlag","nestorgames","Tactical Studies Rules (TSR)"],"designers":["Tom Kruszewski"],"artists":["Dave LaForce","Nathan Morse","Colleen O'Malley","N√©stor Romeral Andr√©s"],"rating":6.81184,"weight":2.6579},

{"id":"321","name":"The Mole in the Hole","description":"A children's game that is equally entertaining for adults.  Players move their moles, who are on a quest to dig underground searching for The Golden Shovel.  A distinctive feature of this game is the multi-part board - there are four boards laid on top of each other, each with holes in it leading 'down' to the next level.  Players move their moles to those holes and, when one board is 'complete' (i.e., all holes occupied), the board, and any moles remaining on it, are removed from play.  Players continue working their way down from level to level, each board having fewer holes than the previous, until they reach the final level, which has only one hole leading to The Golden Shovel.  A simple race-to-the-finish game with fun, colorful playing pieces, just as much fun with or without the kids!&#10;&#10;This game is actually a mild re-working of Inner Circle, also called Top Star, by Virginia Charves.

Each player has room for three sailors (represented by dice) on their ship, and at the start of a round, in order players decide how much money to offer the sailors who will serve as their captain and first mate that round. (The cabin boy always works for free.) Next, in order players roll their dice, then assign one die to each other ship &mdash; never their own! If you place a die with an equal or higher pip value on a ship where a die already present, you bump that earlier die to a lesser role. (In short, the ships always end up with the highest die in the captain position.) One side of each die has a seasick sailor, who doesn't go to sea that round, so not all ships will necessarily be full.&#10;&#10;Once all the dice have been placed, in order players move their ship, ideally reaching islands before others and leaving one of your tokens there. Whenever you land on an island, you reach $25 from the bank, but you must then pay $5 to each player who landed there ahead of you. At the end of a round, players collect the wages next to the captain and first mate spots holding their dice.&#10;&#10;A player who has visited four islands can return to Tonga Bonga Bay, collecting $10 when they dock there.

The game covers the vast theater of operations and the massive forces employed by the Soviet Union and by Nazi Germany and her allies. Only this time, YOU are in command.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Alternate scenarios: Games can be played that start in May or June of 1941, in 1942, or in 1943.&#10;    Unique Combat system: Combat occurs within a hex, units take incremental losses, and battles can require more than one round of resolution.&#10;    Land, Air, and sea: Units are included for and battles occur in all combat environments.&#10;    Blitz Attacks: Armor units may breakthrough fronts to drive deep into enemy territory.&#10;    Variable Endings: End any game at the conclusion of a six month period or continue on to the end of the campaign.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Basic rules allow players to quickly start playing the game and mastering the system. The Advanced and Optional rules allow players to choose the levels of complexity and detail that they enjoy.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: One month per turn. &#10;MAP SCALE: Twenty-five miles per hex. &#10;UNIT SCALE: Corps, armies, fleets, and flotillas. &#10;PLAYERS: Two. &#10;PLAYING TIME: From two to eighteen hours, depending on the scenario and rules used.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;ScenariosIncluded in the game are three scenarios: 1941, 1942, and 1943.  The Barbarossa scenario also has an early start option with some historically plausible options for allowing this.  The '42 scenario, while historical, is quite imbalanced in favor of the Axis player.  Is a great way to practice the Summer '42 turns though so it is certainly recommended.  Finally is the '43 scenario.  This is imbalanced in favor of the Soviet player and is essentially Barbarossa in reverse.  It is very, very important that players practice this one.  It is the best way to learn the strengths of the Soviet side.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Consolidated RulebookThe Avalon Hill Game Company (TAHGC) quickly released a few important errata for the printed game.

However, a new digital rulebook is available for download with all errata already incorporated.  This is also available in the 'files' section.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The Wargame Academy Tournament RulesVarious rules are subject to interpretation.

{"id":"334","name":"Advance to Boardwalk","description":"Don't let the name fool you. The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.&#10;&#10;There are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.&#10;&#10;The 'W' on the special die is a 'wild' color. If it was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.&#10;&#10;When a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.&#10;&#10;Some have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinl&#195;&#164;nder, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk. The player with the highest total value of deeds is the victor.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XrG0R6KuZ2CroUZ8b7Jjcg__thumb/img/4d8ekfGtxfM5tSyskTJ3uqvzCEQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic194793.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XrG0R6KuZ2CroUZ8b7Jjcg__original/img/clB3ZmJeekiSUrCTzbMDh9PDIHw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic194793.jpg","yearpublished":"1985","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":8,"publishers":["Borras Plana S.A.","Editrice Giochi","Parker Brothers","Winning Moves Games (USA)"],"designers":["Charles Phillips"],"artists":[],"rating":5.42863,"weight":1.5278},

If you flip an action card, you must take that action &mdash; often stealing a card from an opponent &mdash; then your turn ends. If you flip a card of the same color as any face-up card, then you instead discard the newly revealed card and your turn ends with you getting nothing. Otherwise, you again face the same options: Collect a face-up card or reveal a new card.&#10;&#10;If on your turn you have three cards of the same value in hand, you can play this trio on the table for a guaranteed 10 points. The game ends either when someone reveals that they have all ten acts in hand or when the deck has been exhausted. You score only for the highest-valued act of each color, so either avoid taking duplicate colors or ditch them in trios. If you have all ten acts in hand, score a 10-point &quot;gala show&quot; bonus.

{"id":"338","name":"Bargain Hunter","description":"This game illustrates Herr Rosenberg&#039;s talent for unique card games.  The deck is one through nine in six suits, with two of each card (two 1s, two 2s, etc.).  After the initial hand of eight is dealt, players select one card value to collect, which is placed face-up in front of each player.  A fairly standard trick-taking game takes place with the remaining cards, with players following suit if they can.  If you cannot, the card you play can be trump, if you desire.  If two cards of the same suit/value appear, the second can be declared as either high or low.  When a player wins a trick, the cards of the same value they are collecting are placed in his 'good' pile, with each worth one point.  All the rest are put in the 'bad' pile, with each worth minus one point.  However at the end of each hand, you can convert one value of cards from your 'bad' pile onto the 'good' pile.  Of course, if you had enough of them, you'll be collecting that value for the next hand...&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8ivvc_2NjujMTmwT3eugeg__thumb/img/bA3ukpm31_Beh3hdMLxNEONZsx8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic681363.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8ivvc_2NjujMTmwT3eugeg__original/img/lJOEut-D4s8Q6sBjwSJaUnXyIPs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic681363.jpg","yearpublished":"1998","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":45,"maxplaytime":"45","minage":10,"publishers":["Queen Games","Valley Games, Inc."],"designers":["Uwe Rosenberg"],"artists":["Reinhard Horst","Patrick LaMontagne"],"rating":6.69711,"weight":1.8657},

{"id":"344","name":"Classic Art","description":"In Classic Art, first released as Members Only, players attempt to predict how many works of art will be present in five exhibitions. The riskier your predictions in a season, the more you score &mdash; but only if you're correct, of course!&#10;&#10;The game consists of 65 cards, with 13 cards in each of five categories; eleven of the cards are &quot;positive&quot; and two are &quot;negative&quot;. At the start of each season, players get a hand of cards (7-11 depending on the player count) and two cards are placed face up from the deck in their respective exhibitions.&#10;&#10;In the first round of the season, players may predict how many works of art will be in an exhibition at the end of the current season by placing 1-2 tokens (along with their high risk token) on a prediction space. Each exhibition allows you to bet on whether the art will be rare (bet spaces 1-4) or plentiful (bet spaces 5-8). In each subsequent round, a player must place two cards from their hand in the appropriate exhibitions, then they may place a prediction. They may place only one &quot;double token&quot; prediction in a season, and predicting is optional. When all players have only three cards in hand, they each discard one face down, then place the other two cards in exhibitions. Whenever a negative card and positive card appear in an exhibition, remove them.&#10;&#10;At the end of a season, players score for correct predictions. If art in an exhibition is &quot;rare&quot;, i.e., four or fewer works, then all plentiful bets fail, and vice versa. What's more, a rare bet succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or fewer than the bet, e.g., if you bet 3, then you succeed only if three or fewer works of art are present. A plentiful bid succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or more than the bet. The riskier the bet, the higher the payout per token in that successful bet, with players recording points separately for each exhibition.&#10;&#10;At the end of a season, tokens on failed bets (other than the high risk ones) are removed from play, while tokens on successful bids are returned to players. If a player has zero or one tokens at the end of a season, all of their tokens are returned to them.&#10;&#10;A player can score at most 10 points in an exhibition. Continue playing seasons until at the end of a season, each exhibition has at least one player who has scored 5 points in it. The game ends at the point, and players tally their scores &mdash; but tokens in the 0-4 range in an exhibition are worthless. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;In Members Only players bet on odd things like how many royal scandals will happen in a month, and in Glenn's Gallery, another version of this design, players bet on the number of customers who will show up to look at types of art, but otherwise gameplay is nearly identical to Classic Art. The only difference is that each player has a dedicated &quot;double bid&quot; token instead of being allowed to bid two tokens once per season.&#10;&#10;Classic Art includes a two-player variant that can be used in prior releases. After dealing eleven cards to each player, set up a ten-card &quot;house&quot; deck. On each player's turn, they play the top card of the house in addition to two cards from their hand. In the last round, play the final two cards from the house along with the chosen two cards from both players.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8U58kYycXuTgnkFCEtL8rQ__thumb/img/F7bK8lnt7tNs5J_IudnI79-DmDg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7424076.png","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8U58kYycXuTgnkFCEtL8rQ__original/img/6itGAfobq0LokM8uqM4Cr-j5Sww=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7424076.png","yearpublished":"1996","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":10,"publishers":["Blatz","CMON Global Limited","Mayfair Games","Group SNE","Planeta Igor"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"artists":["Chris McGloughlin"],"rating":6.59067,"weight":2.087},

It is not one game but three games that can be played with the same set of playing pieces.&#10;&#10;1. Rotten Fish: The first game is about fish in a barrel. Round by round the fish moves toward the rotten bottom of the barrel. The players play one card from their hand. Depending on how many players have chosen a card, fish can be taken from the barrel. &#10;The game ends when a player has five fish on the bottom of the barrel.&#10;&#10;2. Fresh Fish: The card playing mechanism in this variant is similar to the one in Rotten Fish. In this game players try to buy fish from the different &quot;displays&quot; in the barrel.&#10;&#10;3. Fish in the Barrel: By playing their cards players try to sell their fish to the market (the barrel).

{"id":"348","name":"Merchants of the Middle Ages","description":"A Medieval game of trade and commerce, Die H&auml;ndler is set in Europe, where trade wagons carry wares between six cities on the board. Essentially, players buy goods, load them onto wagons and send them for maximum profit in other cities.&#10;&#10;The whole game looks very inviting. The medieval cities depicted on the board, together with the player crests, cardboard coins, money pouches, sticker decorated wagons and wooden commodity pieces, immediately creates the right atmosphere for the players.&#10;&#10;There are six cities - Paris, Cologne, Brugge, Gent, Vienna and Genoa - which are interconnected by roads. Three wagons carry goods from one city to another. No-one owns the wagons or controls any of them single-handedly, and in principle a player can put commodities on any transport. There are six different commodities - salt, iron, wine, silk, cloth and food - all of limited supply.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to make money by delivering goods to the towns, and use the money to buy increases in status.  The game ends after a certain number of deliveries have been made and the winner is the player with the highest level of status.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VXvoSu90Tga1m4JNuApznQ__thumb/img/2SuXA0TJuJ13O8FRV-eYPy2GTYM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1305697.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VXvoSu90Tga1m4JNuApznQ__original/img/q6x5XmribAn5JTK_KeFIG3Dz1cQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1305697.jpg","yearpublished":"1999","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":120,"maxplaytime":"120","minage":10,"publishers":["eggertspiele","Filosofia √âditions","Queen Games","Z-Man Games"],"designers":["Wolfgang Kramer","Richard Ulrich"],"artists":["Jo Hartwig","St√©phane Poinsot"],"rating":6.73159,"weight":3.0131},

The second player has the option to play either a card with the same color, or to open a second trick by playing a card of an different color next to the already played card. When someone plays a second color, he starts a second trick on the table. If the second player started a second trick, the third player just has the options to follow either one of the colors or discard a card of the third color (pass). He may not place a card of the third color on one of the existing tricks or start a third trick. If the second player followed the color of the first card, the third one has the option to start a 2nd trick (and so on).&#10;&#10;The players who played the card with the highest number in the respective trick win the respective cards. They place them visible to everyone in front of themselves on the table, stacked by colors, so everyone can see which color they are collecting.

If you take a trick, you advance your scoring token, however each scoring space can only be occupied by one person, jumping the piece[s] immediately ahead of you. In addition, there are certain spaces which allow that player to set one of the suits as trump. Eventually all the suits are established as some form of trump, however each of them is ranked top to bottom.

{"id":"354","name":"Stick 'Em","description":"In the trick-taking card game Stick 'Em, first released as Sticheln, players seek to gather points each hand by taking as many cards as possible of all but one color, while trying to avoid cards of one color of their choosing.&#10;&#10;In more detail, at the beginning of each hand, each player simultaneously selects and reveals one card from their hand, with the color of this card representing their &quot;pain&quot; color. At the end of the hand, each card of this color that they've collected (including their initial choice from their hand) is worth negative points equal to the card's face value. Each card of another color that this player has collected is worth 1 point.&#10;&#10;To play out the hand, the active player leads a card, then each other player in clockwise order plays one card. If all cards are of the same color, then whoever played the highest card collects these cards, then leads the next trick; if all cards are not of the same color, then whoever played the highest card of a color not initially led collects these cards, then leads the next trick. (One exception: A zero card can never win a trick.) In effect, each color played in a particular trick that doesn't match the color of the card led is considered a trump card, and the highest trump wins. In the event of a tie, the earlier played card breaks the tie.&#10;&#10;Play as many hands as the number of players in the game, summing each player's points over those hands to determine a winner.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Sticheln allow for play with up to six players, while the third and fourth German editions of the game include enough cards to allow for play with up to eight players.

{"id":"355","name":"Das letzte Paradies","description":"In Das letzte Paradies, the players purchase building sites through secret bids, and either build villas or hotels there, or leave the land undeveloped. Buildings are lucrative only if the immediate surrounding area is preserved. The value of nature is appreciated so much more if it is in danger of disappearing. Correspondingly, the price of virgin land varies widely - either very high, or very low - because preservation of nature does not give you income, but it does get you more recognition for your troubles.&#10;&#10;This edge between commerce and nature is rendered even more difficult for the players because at the end (at least in this game) only one pays you money. Who then possesses little at the start, and who has lost in every game, matters little, except who is the richest person at the end.&#10;&#10;Each round, players bid for tiles to lay on the island paradise. One side is a building, the other a forest. The buyer chooses which side to play on. The more forest remains, the more your buildings are worth. However, the more buildings you own, the less forest there will be. Players bid with coins in their closed fist. The highest bidder wins, however, they only pay the cost of the second highest bid. In order to win, you must finish with more money than you started with. As soon as the last building counter has been sold and placed on the board (and any resulting bonuses have been paid) the game ends. All players who have less money than they started with have lost. Out of the remaining players, the winner is the person with the most money.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VzRUe9sMxa3ALb_yawXaLQ__thumb/img/1FiayuRT-vZTQqaRTCCWWkirI70=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6756383.png","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VzRUe9sMxa3ALb_yawXaLQ__original/img/bctZ59IwfpAUWyRGWs6oW4Zh4ag=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6756383.png","yearpublished":"1993","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":12,"publishers":["KOSMOS"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"artists":["Franz Vohwinkel"],"rating":6.01592,"weight":1.84},

Players draw cards to help them do repairs, then fly the course choosing when to take the outside, middle or inside lane. Shake the storm cloud and see which color ball falls into the cap.

{"id":"357","name":"Excape","description":"In Excape, also known as Exxtra and Rapido, you're trying to reach the end of the movement track first, both by rolling doubles (which is a blessed but rare occurrence) and staying on the ranking chart until your next turn.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you first move your pawn 0-5 spaces if your two dice are still on the ranking chart. Next, you roll the dice, which show 1-2-3-4-7-X on one dice and 1-2-3-5-6-X on the other. After your first roll, if you roll doubles, move your pawn 1, 2, or 3 spaces based on what you rolled. You then treat your dice as a two-digit number, say 31, 22, 54, or 70, with the X counting as a 0. You can stop and place your dice on the ranking chart in an empty space &mdash; it contains six spaces numbered 0-5 &mdash; or you can roll again. If you roll doubles, you advance you pawn and face the same choices. If you roll an X or two Xs, then your turn ends and you move your pawn back one or two spaces.&#10;&#10;When you place your dice on the ranking chart, if you place your dice on a lower-numbered space and your two-digit number is equal to or larger than dice that are on a higher-numbered space, then you bump that player's dice off the chart, which means they won't move at the start of their next turn. You can place any number on an unoccupied space, but the higher the space, the greater the odds of you being bumped before your next turn. How risky do you want to play?&#10;&#10;Rapido contains modified rules for two-player games, and you can play with these rules in any version of the game. Each player has two sets of dice, but still only one pawn. If at the start of a turn, you have one or both pairs of dice in front of you, roll like normal, advancing on doubles and hoping to avoid Xs. When you place dice on the ranking chart, you knock off only the opponent's dice, never yours. If at the start of your turn, both pairs of dice are on the ranking chart, advance your pawn the sum of the spaces occupied, then roll a pair of dice.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/90HW-k_LJsDKFeBaRJiGeA__thumb/img/3SLOoWtn6uOjO83n2_y9pdY3Ziw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic440763.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/90HW-k_LJsDKFeBaRJiGeA__original/img/dWid9fB49xFgBhqhAIVZGugHoeA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic440763.jpg","yearpublished":"1998","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":8,"publishers":["AMIGO","Filosofia √âditions","Game Factory","Giochi Uniti"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"artists":["Olivier Fagn√®re","Melanie Friedli","Franz Vohwinkel"],"rating":6.48373,"weight":1.1317},

{"id":"361","name":"Hare & Tortoise","description":"As the first winner of the Spiel des Jahres award in 1979, Hare and Tortoise or the German Hase und Igel (for Hare and Hedgehog) will always be regarded as a classic game.  It is a cunningly designed race to the finish in which your fuel (carrots) must practically run out (all but 10 carrots or fewer) at the moment you hit the finish line.  You also have three lettuce cards you must spend during the course of the race.  The farther you move, the more carrots you spend, and there are a variety of ways to gain or lose carrots as you go around the track.  It's a very clever exercise in arithmetic which David Parlett has fashioned into an entertaining and unique perennial favorite.&#10;&#10;There have several variations between the multiple prints of Hare &amp; Tortoise by different publishers.  Most variations come from methods of adding randomness that favor lagging player via cards, dice, or dice charts when landing on a Hare square.&#10;&#10;&#10;      Parlett Strategic Variant -- The designer's preferred way of playing the Hare square is that &quot;... you can land on them [Hare square], but must miss a turn. This would be the equivalent of the hare taking a nap, as in Aesop's fable. This is the rule I most favour and would prefer it to simply not landing on them at all...&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;      Tournament Jugging the Hare rule -- When you land on a hare square do nothing immediately. If nobody goes past you, draw 10 carrots when you next move. If they do, pay 10 carrots into the carrot patch for each player who goes past you, in either direction.

{"id":"364","name":"Samarkand","description":"A trading game in which you don't trade with the other players.  Instead the commodities are displayed on the board in a number of &quot;nomad camps.&quot;  If your move brings you to a camp, you must present a gift to the camp -- then you can trade your cards for any cards in the camp.  You can also buy goods from the deck at &quot;oasis&quot; squares.  Once you've amassed a number of a particular commodity, you head for the city where that commodity is bought.  There are a few other details to complicate matters, but basically everyone repeats this process until someone has the 500 cash in hand to win the game.  Samarkand is an entertaining exercise with no especially brain-taxing strategies to figure out and makes a good family game.&#10;&#10;This game is sometimes called Bazaar II, because Schmidt Spiele originally published this game under the name Bazaar, even though Bazaar is a completely different game.

By rolling the dice and moving their runners (the most significant decisions are which runners to move, and how far to move them when a choice is available), the players try to keep their teams in front of and as close to the bull as possible, while pushing other runners into more cowardly locations.

Each turn, a number of red and blue sticks are up for grabs.  The highest card played will take the blue sticks and the lowest card will take the red sticks.  The trick is that a red stick cancels a blue stick (that is, a well balanced tightrope walker), and the goal is to score as few points as possible.  However, there are two different ways of playing the game, depending on how players wish to play: strategic or otherwise.  The basic game has players simultaneously playing cards (ala Raj), whereas the strategic version plays like a trick-taking game with players selecting a card sequentially.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Yin Yang/Fifty-Fifty&#10;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FUyJ12REPB7P0lYrJo50lA__thumb/img/6vhs-omn8b7MAZvvEw6bhuBt0Kg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic48609.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FUyJ12REPB7P0lYrJo50lA__original/img/G0Zp_I-WFa7TuAWnSnrMmF9OtMw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic48609.jpg","yearpublished":"1999","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":8,"publishers":["ASS Altenburger Spielkarten","Korokorodou","√úberplay"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"artists":["Alvin Madden","Thorsten Sch√§fer"],"rating":6.18819,"weight":1.3333},
{"id":"369","name":"5ive Straight","description":"A very nice peg-board game, now re-issued. The plastic board has 100 holes, numbered in a oft reversing spiral with 1 in the center. A deck of numbered cards from 1-100 is shuffled and players start with 4 each. You may either play a card and stick a peg in, or draw a card, the hand limit being 4. And of course, you're trying to get five of your pegs in a row to win. Simple, except that playing a card allows you to place a peg in that number, or any empty number above. So with a 60, I can fill a space from 60 to 100, the outside rows effectively, but with a 6, I can play practically anywhere, especially the key points in the center area. The game is for 2-3 players, but works even better when played in partnership, your partner frustrated as you fill high numbers with low cards, you frustrated as your partner fails to block.

{"id":"379","name":"Express","description":"Building trains is an integral part of America's history. Now the tradition continues with Express, a unique card game for the 90's. Reminiscent of classic card games but including new play twists, Express is as easy to learn as rummy. Players start with one or two car trains and build on their meld to maximize points and bonuses. But players must be wary of train wrecks and derailments. Unique play allows partners to pass key cards to each other during the game.&#10;&#10;The cards represent various train cars, freight, passenger and way, diesel locomotives and disasters.&#10;&#10;Cards are shuffled and dealt to each player, and remaining cards form a draw pile.  Turns consist of drawing either two cards from the face down draw pile or one face up card from the discard pile, melding cards from one's hand and discarding a card.  Players must end their turns with no more than five cards in their hands.  Players meld cards to form freight trains or passenger trains, or they meld individual way cars.  Freight trains are melded so that all the cars are of the same type, such as box car, tank car or auto carrier.  However, a wild card car can be used to have two types of cars in the same freight train.  Passenger trains may contain any or all of the different types of passenger cars.  Each train needs a locomotive which can be any card placed face down.  There is a locomotive pictured on the back of each card.  During the melding phase of their turn, players may exchange face down locomotive cards with any card in their hand.  This feature allows partners to share cards when the game is played by four or six.&#10;&#10;Disaster cards may be played as discards.  They can change the direction of play, allow theft of an opponent's car or wreck an entire train.  Way car cards either absorb the damage of corresponding disasters or remedy them in a fashion similar to the Coup Fourre' of Mille Bornes.&#10;&#10;Hands end when a player or partnership &quot;goes out.&quot;  To do this the player's melds must consist of at least one five car train, one four car train and all other trains must be at least three cars long.  The player then melds all but one card which he discards.  Trains and way cars are scored.  Cards left in players hands count against them.&#10;&#10;The game is played in hands until one player or partnership accumulates the points needed to win.  The player or partnership with the most points at the end of that hand wins.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CnpJ3_6rkc4JNhbgDSsevg__thumb/img/THUUZMfUWP3C0ZRd6FaKvX4XAMo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8304810.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CnpJ3_6rkc4JNhbgDSsevg__original/img/JVQKf9cK6MCJTMCSQTrY7L_L2WA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8304810.jpg","yearpublished":"1990","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":8,"publishers":["Mayfair Games","Steve Jackson Games"],"designers":["Darwin Bromley"],"artists":["David B.

{"id":"380","name":"Polarity","description":"Once rare and mysterious, now thankfully back in print, Polarity is a 2-player game using lots of magnets (so keep it away from credit cards, watches and so on). The plastic coated pieces look like Reversi/Othello discs, with black and white faces. Each piece contains a magnet, with the black side being North and the white side being South. Each player gets a stack, one plays black one plays white. A neutral red piece goes in the center of the game cloth and players start by place five each of their stack around the cloth. These flat pieces are the foundations.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you take one piece from your stack into your hand, then bring it to bear against one of your foundations. You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.&#10;&#10;Get it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.&#10;&#10;If a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.&#10;&#10;To be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.&#10;&#10;If you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat. If you want a serious 2-player game, you may prefer other abstracts. The rules could do with being shorter and simpler. Otherwise, a joyous game.&#10;&#10;Comment from the designer &quot;Polarity began as a sculpture. Polarity is zen. It represents that point where absolute opposites merge. In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by one's ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced. It is in that uniqueness that I was awarded a patent from the U.S. Pat. &amp; Trdmks. office for magnetic principle. The strategy must be viewed 3-dimensionally. It is not just control of a 2-dimensional board but must include the space above and below the playing surface.&quot;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9LzoU2xaS3jezOxNM5PddA__thumb/img/hFnab7US5H-hYVfFxtJaS4GoYXM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic175963.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9LzoU2xaS3jezOxNM5PddA__original/img/OjXcjJeSprkiQupXH1CR3uEiMyY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic175963.jpg","yearpublished":"1986","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":20,"maxplaytime":"20","minage":8,"publishers":["Blue Opal","EKOS","Ekos-USA, Inc.","Ferti","IRWIN Games","Kids On Science, Inc.","Polarity House, Inc.","Tangent Toy Co.","Telemotion Technologies","Temple Games, Inc."],"designers":["Douglas Seaton"],"artists":[],"rating":6.34913,"weight":1.6814},

{"id":"383","name":"Turf Horse Racing","description":"Classic Knizia betting and racing game. Initially players bet on the horses as they are dealt from the deck, then the horses race on the die roll, the course being 40 spaces. The cards &amp; die have 4 symbols, jockey's hat, boot, horse shoe and horse's head; the head is on the die 3 times, giving it a 50% chance of being rolled. The cards have different values against each symbol, showing how far they move when that symbol is rolled. But the number against the horse's head is always 1 to 7 for the same horse. So Raven Beauty always has a 50% chance of moving 7 spaces, Lagoon Lady moves 4, and poor old Roamin' Emporer goes 1 space. The trick, and it's a good trick, is that the other 3 values vary wildly for the lower horses, making them outside chances to win. One lucky roll and Roamin' Emporer can leap forward 20 places! So do you bet on the steady goers, or take a gamble on the nags? Players take turns to roll the die and choose which horse moves, so with a good roll you move one you've bet on, with a bad roll you move someone else's horse. Points are awarded to 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd home, and one of your bets is a doubler.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Winner&#039;s Circle / Royal Turf &#10;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jddKraLJ0h40DvSTaoH_EA__thumb/img/PEumwMq9RlP3h6I-yvggJfJzBFM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5238648.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jddKraLJ0h40DvSTaoH_EA__original/img/JOTiszG-QpkdHn2oQOVp3p309ew=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5238648.jpg","yearpublished":"1995","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":10,"publishers":["Gibsons"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"artists":[],"rating":6.43086,"weight":1.8},
{"id":"384","name":"TurfMaster","description":"Turfmaster is a horse-racing game for two to eight players, played over a &quot;meet&quot; of three races.  The board is two-sided, and hurdles are provided so that players can choose flat racing or steeplechases (races with fences that the horses must jump).&#10;&#10;Players each have their own deck of 32 movement cards, dice and a horse of their own colour.  Ten cards are randomly selected for each race, with two cards left over which can be drawn for use in any one race.  Cards played in a race are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;A round consists of two parts.  First all players simultaneously select a card and move the number on the played card (if able), in position order.  After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).&#10;&#10;Like a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have &quot;joker&quot; cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.&#10;&#10;The first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.&#10;&#10;The game comes in two versions.  The regular version which has single-colour plastic horses, and the &quot;DeLuxe&quot; version which has hand-painted pewter horses (each jockey wears a different coloured jersey) - each in a little protective case.   In addition, several other tracks are available - there are two course collections which can be purchased separately and a third (web-published) collection.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CFHt1QjC5wrqgUbGkALSlg__thumb/img/4KxqJ6A8IyNwpIDl87lohBYwf_U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic289677.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CFHt1QjC5wrqgUbGkALSlg__original/img/LQExn-kA3uxS6ujqHolG0z5nVpo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic289677.jpg","yearpublished":"1998","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":8,"minplaytime":75,"maxplaytime":"75","minage":10,"publishers":["AZA Spiele"],"designers":["Albrecht Nolte"],"artists":["Stefan Niehues","Peter R√∂seler"],"rating":7.2489,"weight":1.949},

{"id":"391","name":"Ocean","description":"The idea is for players to populate the various oceans with large schools of fish, and then strategically place their animals so they can eat the greatest value of fish.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of the game are simple. There are five oceans which are set out in a column. The rest of the cards are divided into two decks: fish and animals. Fish cards carry values from 0 - 3 points each.&#10;&#10;A player fills his hand with five cards, of which at least one must be an animal card. All animal cards in a player's possession are placed face-up in front of him. Animals are color coded to specific oceans and may only be played on that ocean. Fish may be played on any ocean.&#10;&#10;Players then alternate playing cards to the oceans. Fish cards are played to the right side of an ocean, while animal cards are played to the left of their respective 'home' ocean. Each 'side' may only contain a maximum of five cards.&#10;&#10;The idea is to time the placement of your animal cards so as to score the most points based on the value of the fish already played to that ocean. So, if three fish cards had been played to the Atlantic Ocean, worth 1, 2 ad 0 points respectively (for a total of 3 points), the first player to play an animal card on that ocean (it must be THE animal which can be played on that ocean) will score 3 points. The second player to plan an animal card to that ocean scores double the points (6 points). The third player to place an animal on that ocean scores triple the points (9 points); etc.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c26cEtrDKBk5exGPPRN4ug__thumb/img/6AyCKRCiaOm6MVKd7x7889i2l-o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic53640.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c26cEtrDKBk5exGPPRN4ug__original/img/kOKVFga0zppXD7q3ZJTcA3PZwZg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic53640.jpg","yearpublished":"1999","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":20,"maxplaytime":"20","minage":8,"publishers":["Adlung-Spiele"],"designers":["Peter Schurzmann"],"artists":["L√°szl√≥ Csatai"],"rating":4.78431,"weight":1},

{"id":"393","name":"Dinosaurs of the Lost World","description":"One of Avalon Hill&#039;s family games that appeals to gamers as well.  Players control different expeditions which they equip to explore the Lost World.  Victory is achieved through finding various species of dinosaurs and collecting specimens.  The game comes with a modular board to ensure that no two games are alike, and lots of dinosaur stand-up pieces.  One of the most entertaining parts of the game occurs when a dinosaur chases an expedition back to base camp!&#10;&#10;&#10;This Avalon Hill game has features beyond most family games that appeals to strategy gamers and increase replayability.  First, the board is modular; the location of all the dinosaur sites and required items is completely random every game.  This sort of feature, unusual before the German games of the 90's, puts Dinosaurs of the Lost World years ahead of its time.&#10;&#10;Second, players may influence and interact with other players both indirectly by moving dinosaurs in their path or directly by either trading items amicably or attacking their expedition mercilessly.&#10;&#10;Third-The sharp limits set out in the rules on weapons and ammunition force the players to pick their battles carefully and makes each dinosaur encounter thrilling and high stakes.  Followed strictly, the rules give the dinosaurs a real possibility of winning a combat and requires strategic planning from players if they hope to avoid being chased right out of the game.&#10;&#10;Fourth- The consequences of losing a dinosaur combat are serious.  During the chase you may lose one or more useful tools and even victory points.  Once you escape from the dinosaur, you are returned to camp and lose your next turn.  Because actions that can be taken in camp are somewhat limited, a lost dinosaur battle completely knocks out one turn and diminishes what can be accomplished in two additional turns.&#10;&#10;Finally- The game has excellent style.  The dinosaur areas are displayed in a unique &ldquo;comic book&rdquo; format, allowing for great enjoyment and immersion from all players regardless of age.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m4xbOcRLX3gHyRWiIFZzFA__thumb/img/iCyZq25wQU2W13uliDCXZ1VKkWA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic675608.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m4xbOcRLX3gHyRWiIFZzFA__original/img/tQh3Zt-oHeMXZU0N4pOkT3zyNvY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic675608.jpg","yearpublished":"1987","minplayers":1,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":90,"maxplaytime":"90","minage":8,"publishers":["The Avalon Hill Game Co"],"designers":["Mick Uhl"],"artists":["James Talbot"],"rating":6.65926,"weight":1.8936},
{"id":"394","name":"Kahuna","description":"&quot;Who will rule the South Seas? Two Kahuna - ancient sorcerers of the Pacific - compete for dominance on an archipelago consisting of twelve small islands. Using their magic and wisdom, they struggle for control of the islands. They anxiously await the cards handed to them by fate. But when the time is right, they move to capture one, two, or even more islands, trying to gain the upper hand. At the mercy of the magical powers of the South Seas, they quickly realize that even the best magic is no good without strategy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Originally published in 1997 as Arabana-Ikibiti by the designer's own publisher Bambus Spieleverlag, then reprinted by Funagain in the U.S., Kosmos' Kahuna &ndash; part of its Kosmos two-player series &ndash; is the best known implementation of this design.&#10;&#10;It's a two-player game, played on a board depicting twelve islands. Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island &ndash; which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.&#10;&#10;The game is played in three rounds. A round ends when all cards from the face down deck and the three face up cards have been taken. Then points are scored for the islands with a marker stone on them. The game can also end sooner when one player has absolutely NO bridges left on the board.&#10;&#10;The Kosmos edition has excellent graphics and nice wooden pieces and plays very well.&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;     Arabana-Ikibiti&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;     Kanaloa&#10;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UdhhVlmQihMbvlNSvY1lUA__thumb/img/bc5NxkspfUfPskxlC30SxlwNyxs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2606165.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UdhhVlmQihMbvlNSvY1lUA__original/img/eFUPl6jyG6enyuTqqEE-4vGw7NI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2606165.jpg","yearpublished":"1998","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":2,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"40","minage":10,"publishers":["KOSMOS","999 Games","Arclight Games","Filosofia √âditions","Galakta","IELLO","Korea Boardgames","Laser plus","Paper Iyagi","Rio Grande Games","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.","Tilsit","White Goblin Games"],"designers":["G√ºnter Cornett"],"artists":["Michaela Kienle","Anke Pohl","Thilo Rick","Claus Stephan"],"rating":6.61266,"weight":2.0543},

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;A Fantasy themed miniatures wargame without the miniatures.  Will you play as the ubiquitous Elves, the barbaric Uthuk Yllan, the stalwart Dwarves, the vile Undead, the medieval Knights, the desert dwelling Acolytes, the mighty Dragon kin, or the vicious Orcs?  Players choose a faction from the eight available in the base game and an army point value for the battle. Each must then build an army using the double-sided cardboard disks and battle it out.  At least half of the army points must be from one faction and the remaining points are made up of like aligned or neutral disks and spells.&#10;&#10;Each double-sided disk represents either a faction homeland (your starting area), a terrain (ruins, forest, swamp etc... with effects on combat and line of sight), a spell(levels 1-3), a missile or one unit with its alignment (Good, Neutral, or Evil) with values for its Attack, Defense, Toughness, Movement and the army point cost of the disk. The disks have varying sizes (Giants and Dragons tend to be larger) and most units have a wide variety special abilities such as flying, the spell-casting ability or the missile ability to launch boulders, bolts, arrows or fireballs for example.  Players take it in turn activating 3 units(disks) and resolving battles, casting spells, and firing missiles.&#10;&#10;Activated Unit disks are moved around the table by flipping them end over end a number of times up to their movement value.  If the disk lands on top of an opposing army disk a battle ensues with the top disk (the attacker) doing its attack damage value to the lower disk (the defender) who applies its defense value to the attacker if the damage is equal or greater to either unit's toughness it is either wounded or killed. Combats can involve numerous disks upon top of each other and are resolved top down. Missiles can be fired by missile capable units at disks within range by dropping them upon the target from a foot above the table. Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on.  This can result in 'friendly fire' damage on your own troops and adds an element of luck/dexterity to the game.&#10;&#10;The game rules come with multiple scenarios that accommodate 2 to 8 players.  The  victory goal of each scenario can vary from king of the hill, to enemy elimination, to just about any combat scenario victory condition one could imagine.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rtKI7tyfQtzv1OzogfDG0Q__thumb/img/eI0nTjUBGuvESkmG-Pr7NBB7ppw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic391542.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rtKI7tyfQtzv1OzogfDG0Q__original/img/TCXlxvug5AMFqJEaA1f1qLr6NxY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic391542.jpg","yearpublished":"1999","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":8,"minplaytime":90,"maxplaytime":"90","minage":10,"publishers":["AMIGO","Fantasy Flight Games","Tilsit"],"designers":["Tod Gelle","Darrell Hardy","Tom Jolly","Christian T.

{"id":"398","name":"Wildlife Safari","description":"Wildlife Safari was originally published by AMIGO as Flinke Pinke. This game is one of those 'painfully simple' Reiner Knizia games. There are five different colored chips, with six cards, zero through five, in each of the colors.  The cards are dealt out, and then players take turns playing a card and taking any available chip.  When one color has all six cards played on it, then the game is over, and players use the last card played in each category to value their chips.  The highest total value wins.&#10;&#10;Description of 1994 Milton Bradley re-issue Quandary, for 2-4 players:&#10;&#10;A game of placement, shares and nerve by Reiner Knizia, this is a lovely edition with nice, heavy tiles akin to Mah-jong pieces in weight and feel. Players in turn lay numbered pieces on tracks curling to the centre, and then take a share in any colour. The round ends when a track is filled. Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible. Then you'll want to play a blue 5 to raise your possible score, but must take a share in a different colour. Same game, different production.&#10;&#10;Description of 2003 Fantasy Flight Games re-issue, Loco!, for 2-4 players:&#10;&#10;Here is the FOURTH version of the game that was originally Flinke Pinke only this time, the added &quot;rule&quot; is that whenever you play a card with a value of &quot;0&quot;, you must say &quot;Loco!&quot; aloud or forfeit your opportunity to select one of the colored chips.  Apart from that, the game is identical.&#10;&#10;Description of the 2010 Eagle-Gryphon Games games re-issue, Botswana, for 2-5 players:&#10;&#10;This fifth version of the game adds a safari theme. Rules and gameplay are unchanged from the original version (no rules about animal noises), but the chips are replaced by plastic animal figures and the cards are covered in matching animal fur patterns. In 2014, Gryphon Games released a new edition of this game as Wildlife Safari, featuring the same components and artwork but changing the title of the game.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gQJDSsdGmD95yZmetiGsRg__thumb/img/rJUFkz9YFgf8i33gJCeVAv7TYZY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8550221.png","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gQJDSsdGmD95yZmetiGsRg__original/img/utaTB4H_KVSB5ZY5VQHnc0ATLNw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8550221.png","yearpublished":"1994","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":20,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":7,"publishers":["AMIGO","25th Century Games","AURUM, Inc.","Eagle-Gryphon Games","Esdevium","Fantasy Flight Games","Midgaard Games","Milton Bradley","Muduko","New Games Order, LLC","PS-Games","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"artists":["Charlie Bink","goo","Weberson Santiago","Piotr Soko≈Çowski"],"rating":6.75458,"weight":1.2921},

Each of the cards allows for a certain number of road tile placements from your supply, a number of maneuvers per turn, and the damage your current speed will inflict should you careen into another car. Additionally, a percent of the tiles have special actions associated with them, which give the car on them the ability to jump, or hit a semi-truck, or skid out of control, or just plain slow down 'cuz there's a Smokey comin' on his flipside...

{"id":"416","name":"A to Z","description":"Each player receives a plastic board with 25 spaces on it labeled A to Z (with X and Y sharing a space). The playing board has spaces marked 15, 30, hand and 2. Each player takes a turn moving the single pawn around the board. Once you land on a space, another player draws a card (each with 6 categories on them), looks up your die roll on that card and reads the corresponding category. If you landed on a 15 or 30 you have that many seconds to think of as many words in that category as you can and for each word you can come up with, you cover the appropriate space on your plastic board with a chip. The aim is to be first to fill all 25.&#10;&#10;If you land on a hand, you get 15 seconds and choose another player. For every word you think of you can pull a chip off of their board that starts with the appropriate letter. If you land on the 2 space you can cover 2 spaces on your board for free (handy for Q and X, Y, Z).&#10;&#10;The timer is obnoxiously loud by intent (very distracting) and flips over very suddenly, scaring people who aren't used to it, to mark the end of the time limit.&#10;&#10;Basically, this is a very simple word enumerating party style game that's quick and easy to learn and frustrating for people with poor vocabularies or stalled minds.&#10;&#10;Many years ago, while still known as Nelospelit, Tactic already used the title Ord Mani for an earlier word game; these are different games, although some similarities do exist.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WEozFnlyFQw_zPncm_ELOw__thumb/img/M-2p8rhJkWBNO8qyvxp2nmjXgQU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic127151.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WEozFnlyFQw_zPncm_ELOw__original/img/3PDyLSjJDgwGNF8BXO43azhwUk4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic127151.jpg","yearpublished":"1992","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":9,"publishers":["F.X.

{"id":"420","name":"Rail Baron","description":"Rail Baron is one of the earlier train games - boardgames with a railroad theme.&#10;&#10;Players move trains along historical USA railroad lines and collect delivery payoffs. They compete to purchase the railroads in order to assemble a network that gives access to important map destinations while simultaneously trying to prevent their opponents from doing so.&#10;&#10;From the Box (Avalon Hill Bookshelf Game)&#10;Only in America!&#10;&#10;You are living in the heyday of the locomotive. You are Jay Gould. And you have just added another railroad to your vast railroad empire. Flushed with success, you now retire to the sartorial splendor of your very own Pullman Palace Car. The dream ends. You awaken to reality with the thought... &quot;just another fantasy.&quot; Ahh, but for the grace of Avalon Hill, you dream continues.&#10;&#10;Here, in Rail Baron, you become a latter day Gould, or a Cornelius Vanderbilt, or any of those menacingly infamous moguls whose wizardry and acumen established the criteria for which business success was to be judged in decades to come.&#10;&#10;Rail Baron is played on a large board of the United States RR network. in fact, it comes in three separate boards. Laid end to end, it spell out America and portrays the 28 major rail lines and major cities they connected during the halcyon days of railroading.&#10;&#10;You start with $20,000 - and a train. You make money on trips from city to city. Pretty soon you've got enough money to build up your empire (you can buy the B&amp;O and C&amp;O for just $44,000). More holdings bring more money your way (track rental) from your opponents.&#10;&#10;With many new nuances of strategy, it becomes a game where fortunes see-saw until the last rail baron is bankrupt - or has accumulated the $200,000 needed to win.&#10;&#10;All of this may take 3 to 4 hours.

{"id":"425","name":"Thunder's Edge","description":"From the website&#10;Thunder's Edge is a science-fiction board game of politics, strategy and giant mecha for two to five players. Each player controls one of Earth's factions, each of which is trying to exert power over the planet Thunder's Edge. To win, players must gain the support of important lobby groups within the government, hold key locations on Thunder's Edge by military force, and fight for control of vital off-world locations.&#10;&#10;from review by Nickjost:&#10;Play begins by setting up the board. The board is composed of hexes a la Settlers of Catan. These hexes are dealt out to the players who may look at them and then deploy them face down one at a time. The players then receive an initial allotment of money. They may spend this money to purchase units for the initial planet-fall. Any money that isn't spent is doubled. Opening strategies are based on buying enough infantry to hold any cities that you can know of (from the hexes dealt) and deploying those infantry to guard those cities.&#10;&#10;There are also several other components. First, is the tension track. This is essentially a turn marker. Once the tension track is exhausted the game ends. There are also a few off-world locations that provide special bonuses. Military units also make use of the transit and orbit boards. Units in &quot;transit&quot; are moved to &quot;orbit&quot;. Units in &quot;orbit&quot; can be deployed to the board. This introduces a minimum one turn delay from when an item is purchased to when it can be deployed.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Thunder&#039;s Edge: Demon Canyon&#10;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GS8yXuAtoENWPBhbhs_sBA__thumb/img/gf4LHPqjvUOOq_VrQzN95fXKBtw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic82172.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GS8yXuAtoENWPBhbhs_sBA__original/img/g7EPkhW0ZvZ9M1ZRWj42fy_JA5U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic82172.jpg","yearpublished":"1999","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":180,"maxplaytime":"300","minage":12,"publishers":["Fantasy Flight Games"],"designers":["Christian T.

{"id":"431","name":"Alhambra: The Card Game","description":"Alhambra: The Card Game is a game that both inspired and was named after the more popular, award-winning game and franchise, Alhambra.&#10;&#10;This game has been released in several different versions, with the same core rules but different themes. The 2010 release of the game re-themed what was then called Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game, after the popular Game: Alhambra franchise and related, award-winning game Alhambra.  Alhambra, is itself derived from Stimmt So!. The original version of the game, Al Capone, was published in 1992 by a self-publishing company, db-Spiele, which was owned by the game designer Dirk Henn.&#10;&#10;The re-theming of Stimmt So! and Alhambra: The Card Game resulted in the same game with different themes and only minor differences. Changes between Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game include:&#10;1) The initial money rules from Alhambra are used.&#10;2) The 2 player variant rules from Alhambra are used.&#10;&#10;Stimmt So! A description of this version:&#10;Using mechanics similar to Union Pacific or its predecessor, Airlines, this game is about acquiring stock interests in the various aspects of a large corporation.  There are six &#10;different types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game.  Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue.  Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen).  The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board.  A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks.  If you pay more than the amount indicated on the stock card, the excess is lost.  However, if you purchase the stock for the exact printed price, then you can buy another stock, and so on.  After two randomly distributed payouts, the game ends with a final payout with the final stock card.  The player with the highest payout point total is the winner.&#10;&#10;Al Capone  A description of this version:&#10;Using Influence cards, you collect Trade cards from different areas of town under the Mafia control, giving you control over the Distillery, the Chinese Laundry, the Betting Shop, etc. If you spend the exact amount of Influence required, you get another turn, and so on. Scoring occurs randomly twice during the game and at the end. When the first scoring occurs, only the majority holder in each Trade scores. When the second scoring occurs, the first and second majority holders score, and at the final scoring, the first three majority holders score. Ties are split accordingly.&#10;&#10;Other versions/re-themes:&#10;Alhambra Bonn card game is Alhambra the card game with the Bonn theme. Originally as a limited run for Bonn, Germany and surrounding areas. There is also a Alhambra New York card game which is currently out of print, as well as an Alhambra Nederland card game. The re-themes are collectors items that people like to collect.&#10;&#10;Player Counts:&#10;Earlier versions typically had a player count of 3-6 players while more recent versions, such as New York, is listed as 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0sIAdfhWnYkF6SjU6_BPfw__thumb/img/wm7wr8pyt1q_U0iHhQNfWlYF6M8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1102461.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0sIAdfhWnYkF6SjU6_BPfw__original/img/Ln3mILAxCGThvC4MgURvz5sZCjs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1102461.jpg","yearpublished":"1992","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":45,"maxplaytime":"45","minage":10,"publishers":["Queen Games","db-Spiele","Piatnik"],"designers":["Dirk Henn"],"artists":["Jo Hartwig","Reinhard Horst"],"rating":6.42816,"weight":1.72},

Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in its row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WuOY1XAIJQ-RGAmT_apW_w__thumb/img/dhNHd8Ztln_lUFAdti6WkPnGTGg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8632998.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WuOY1XAIJQ-RGAmT_apW_w__original/img/06TSBC2s-cwbxfPmy_pf7n5p-jM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8632998.jpg","yearpublished":"1994","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":10,"minplaytime":45,"maxplaytime":"45","minage":8,"publishers":["AMIGO","999 Games","Albi","Asmodee","Brain Games","Broadway Toys LTD","Bureau de Juegos","Bur√≥","Carletto","Copag Cards","Dal Negro","Dr. Wood Challenge Centre","Endless Games (I)","Fractal Juegos","G3","Gigamic","Giochi Uniti","Kaissa Chess & Games","K√§rnan","Kikigagne?","Korea Boardgames","Land of Beautiful Mind (ÿ≥ÿ±ÿ≤ŸÖ€åŸÜ ÿ∞ŸáŸÜ ÿ≤€åÿ®ÿß)","Last Level","Lautapelit.fi","Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd","Mar L√∫dico","Max Bersinger","Mayfair Games","Mercurio","Midgaard Games","MIPL","M√∂bius Games","Nelospelit","Pando Games","Paper Iyagi","Piatnik","Rebel Sp. z o.o.","Shafir Games (◊î◊û◊©◊ó◊ß◊ô◊ù ◊©◊ú ◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊©◊§◊ô◊®)","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.","Tempo Games (I)","U.S. Games Systems, Inc.","VR Distribution"],"designers":["Wolfgang Kramer"],"artists":["Timur Baskakov","Design Edge","Oliver Freudenreich","Bill Herrin","Gatis Sluka","Franz Vohwinkel"],"rating":6.97349,"weight":1.1922},
{"id":"433","name":"Shark","description":"Shark is a stock-trading game slightly reminiscent of Acquire in that abstract play on the game board determines the share values of the various companies.  The similarities end there, though, as Shark is more free-wheeling than Acquire.&#10;&#10;At the start of your turn, you can buy shares (up to five) and sell shares (as many as you want), then you roll dice to determine which of the four company markers you place on the board and in which region. A company marker on its own doesn't contribute to the value of a company; only groups of at least two markers count, so groups of 5, 4, 1, and 1 markers would create a value of $9,000 for each of that company's shares. If you place a marker that combines those two lone markers, then you'd have groups of 5, 4, and 3, so the share price would shoot to $12,000. If you placed that marker on its own, the share price wouldn't change. When you place a marker, you gain money equal to that company's new share price, so you have an incentive to boost a company's size &mdash; but all players receive funds equal to the difference between the old share price and new for each share they hold, so are you enriching them more than yourself?&#10;&#10;Of course, you can also place a marker to tank a company's share price. When a company's group expands to touch a smaller group, that smaller group is removed from the board, lowering the value of that company's shares (as long as the group had at least two markers) and costing everyone money equal to the loss in value. (Groups of equal size cannot touch, and you cannot place a marker to force a smaller group to touch a larger one.) To end your turn, you can again sell as many shares as you want and buy shares up to the per-turn limit of five.&#10;&#10;Removed markers are banished from the game, not returned to the supply. Once all of a company's markers have been used, or a company's share price reaches $15,000, or all of the shares have been sold, the game ends, and players cash out all their shares to see who has the most money.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wU-CelFCsMaOrhWwAiny0g__thumb/img/yBv4f9_eXfmfuh6bFTGT_QTQOao=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6985693.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wU-CelFCsMaOrhWwAiny0g__original/img/gjJVZP30YNCeFmPxxpZyTkBS85g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6985693.jpg","yearpublished":"1987","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":90,"maxplaytime":"90","minage":12,"publishers":["BGA Plus","Falomir Juegos","Flying Turtle Games","Korea Boardgames","Otto Maier Verlag","Ravensburger","Rio Grande Games"],"designers":["H.

{"id":"437","name":"Master Labyrinth","description":"This earlier Master Labyrinth is very different than the 2007 dragon-themed Master Labyrinth.&#10;&#10;Part of the Ravensburger Labyrinth Games series, this game is based on the simpler, original Labyrinth game. It is played on a board with maze tiles (straight, L, and T shaped corridors) randomly arranged on it.  Players are represented on the board by little wizard pawns.  Players are wizards-in-training, and they are charged with exploring the maze and finding all the ingredients (numbered chips) needed to become a Wizard.  The trick is that chips must be claimed in numerical order.  Perhaps the most novel aspect of this game is that players mutate the maze by sliding a tile onto the board from the side, which hopefully will enable them to travel to the next ingredient.  Once all twenty-one items have been claimed, the highest total score wins, but each player also holds a secret recipe worth bonus points if they were able to capture three specific ingredients.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aO1Yr8UG_2EsWh3s2WoF4g__thumb/img/prJQcEQh1ytDT5UVLiilzqWdr8M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2888783.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aO1Yr8UG_2EsWh3s2WoF4g__original/img/UX6fkyg90dLUn0OY5GjTt1ejdfU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2888783.jpg","yearpublished":"1991","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":20,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":10,"publishers":["Ravensburger","M√°l og menning","Otto Maier Verlag"],"designers":["Max J.

{"id":"440","name":"Zoff in Buffalo","description":"Once a year, Buffalo City goes beef crazy. Cowboys drive their cows here to the biggest auction in the Wild West. The players must attempt to find grazing for their cows on the limited pasture.&#10;&#10;Which beef baron will most cleverly play his cards?&#10;&#10;Players have 10 cards to play which specify a number of cows.  Each round features a simultaneous selection of 2 of the 10 cards and a designation of which of the several pastures (the number of pastures in the game depends on the number of players) you'll try to place the cows in.  The tricky part starts with the rule that no two players can ever have exactly the same number of cows in a given pasture.  So if you plan to put 4 cows in a certain pasture, but somebody else has exactly 4 there already when your turn comes around, you'll only get to put 3 of them in -- and if somebody else has exactly 3 there already, you'll only get to put 2 of them in.  And it's very detrimental to your gameplan if you don't get to play all the cows you're entitled to!&#10;&#10;When a pasture is completely filled with cows, there are bonuses paid in the form of a chance to put extra cows into other pastures, but perversely, the better bonuses go to the players with the second or third most cows, not the first most.  This is the *really* tricky part.&#10;&#10;The game ends after five swift rounds and all 10 of your cards played, maybe half an hour from start to finish.

{"id":"443","name":"Code 777","description":"The clever little game Code 777 combines the elements of a good, logical deduction game and Indian poker. Each player receives a rack for keeping three tiles drawn from a pool of tiles, which are seven different numbers in seven different colors (28 tiles in total); however, the rack is turned away from you. When players sit in a circle, each player can see everyone else's tiles, except their own. Each turn, players draw a card with a question like, &quot;Do you see more yellow sevens or more blue sevens?&quot; which should help the others determine their tiles. Once you're reasonably sure of which tiles you have in front of you, you can take a guess &mdash; but if you're wrong, you have to start over with a fresh set of tiles ...&#10;&#10;Code 777 was explicitly inspired by What's That on My Head?, and Alex Randolph credited Robert Abbott with co-designing this game based on that inspiration.&#10;&#10;In 2010, Stronghold Games released Code 777: 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, adding both a fifth player to the game and symbols to make it colorblind-friendly.

{"id":"444","name":"Escape from the Hidden Castle","description":"Although billed as a children's game, Escape from the Hidden Castle, a.k.a. Midnight Party or Hugo, is actually quite enjoyable by adults as a light, fun game. Each player controls a number of guests at a party, with the number of guests dependent on the number of players. These guests start the round in the spaces of the gallery on the game board, one guest per space; this initial placement is a large part of a player's strategy.&#10;&#10;The Phantom (or &quot;Hugo the ghost&quot; in earlier versions) starts in the cellar, then climbs the stairs towards the gallery where the guests circle. The mechanism for the Phantom's movement is simple: On a player's turn, he rolls a special die. If he gets a number, he moves his pieces; if he gets a Phantom, the Phantom moves. This means that with more players in the game, the Phantom moves a lot more frequently, so you must adjust your strategy accordingly.&#10;&#10;Once the Phantom has reached the gallery, the guests can start ducking into rooms adjoining the gallery to avoid him, with only one guest per room! A couple of rooms are special in that they add or subtract extra &quot;fright points&quot; from your score. As the Phantom catches up with the remaining guests, they are sequestered on the stair steps, then in the cellar. The first guest caught &quot;earns&quot; the most fright points, with those caught later in the round earning less and less.&#10;&#10;Once all the guests have been caught, the fright points are tallied.

The web is a spiral, you roll the die and move Auntie, then take turns to move one of your bugs towards the exit space. Initially, Auntie is in a good mood, if she runs into a bug or bugs, they go back to her larder. But as soon as someone escapes, she loses her temper and kills anything she catches! The game has a scoring track, and each time a bug is caught or escapes, a marker moves up, also adding a number to the die roll. So Auntie runs around the web faster and faster. Players can share some spaces, but most of the time, bump each other back and forth. Naturally, nasty bugs push others into Aunty's path to certain death!&#10; Slightly confusing when you start, this is actually a really simple game, easily as good as any D&amp;F game.

{"id":"457","name":"Jumbo Grand Prix","description":"The goal of Jumbo Grand Prix is to create strong race cars that score the most racing points.&#10;&#10;Every player starts with 4 cards. In the next 4 rounds they try to build a competitive race car by changing their cards. A race car consists of a coach-work card, a tire card, an engine card, and a driver card. After 4 rounds, all the players show their race car for that race. The strength is the sum of the 4 played cards. The stronger the combination, the higher your finish place. In case of a tie, the value of the driver decides. Whenever you cannot make a complete car, you cannot take part in that race. When your coach-work, tires, and engine have the same value, the combination is worth 21 points, in spite of their original value. Then you add the value of the driver. When your driver is also of the same value, the total combination is worth 28 points.&#10;&#10;When it's your turn, you can choose one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;     1. Discard 1 of your cards (face up) and draw 2 new ones. The new cards can be drawn from the visible cards or from the closed pile. The 4 open piles are sorted by type. &#10;     2. Keep all your cards and draw 1 new card (from an open or the closed pile). &#10;&#10;&#10;So every turn you get 1 extra card. After 4 turns you have 8 cards, from which you must build your race car. The other 4 cards are used in the next round. Whenever you draw a card from one of the open piles, it is always the top one. From the type you just handed in, you cannot draw a new one from that type's open pile. At the start of each round, as many scoring cards are revealed as there are players. The winner gets the highest card and so on. Every player receives points, unless you cannot take part in the race. As soon as all scoring cards are used, the racing season is over. The player with the highest total of scoring cards wins the season (and the game).&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UM1OR0l-r9V-yX2YE8pRXA__thumb/img/eMyNq1SBK7YSnv9qqwl34vsDmyw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5238171.png","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UM1OR0l-r9V-yX2YE8pRXA__original/img/VxTjeUN5jCrnS06enAKja9lefxs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5238171.png","yearpublished":"1998","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":8,"publishers":["Jumbo"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"artists":[],"rating":5.84526,"weight":1.4},

I can use an Inspector, Arrest or Alibi card on my opponents and so on.

Players use cards to move their cars forward a number of spaces, however the tracks often have 'choke' points where few cars can race side-by-side (not unlike Kramer&#039;s Detroit/Cleveland Grand Prix system).  The track is constructed from three double-sided half-boards, which can be combined in a number of different ways for easier and harder tracks.  For the advanced game, each player's movement cards can be divided different ways, depending on the strategy that he wishes to employ for the given track.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hE4Pt-dGovS2PjL6BITugQ__thumb/img/h_ooD2TqtXh3_I78KfQUhqxWI1o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4060428.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hE4Pt-dGovS2PjL6BITugQ__original/img/uimQZ8GyG72fT1OPT5wVMO1Otbg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4060428.jpg","yearpublished":"1993","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":45,"maxplaytime":"45","minage":10,"publishers":["ASS Altenburger Spielkarten"],"designers":["Wolfgang Riedesser"],"artists":[],"rating":6.87457,"weight":1.6},
{"id":"460","name":"Railway Rivals","description":"This is a classic simple railway racing game, perhaps the first modern railroading game, where you draw the railway lines on hex-board. This one uses the sort of colored marker pens you can wipe off with a damp cloth after the game. The game goes through phases; initially you draw tracks and earn money for linking cities. When a number of cities are joined, you start racing, the cities being chosen randomly. The races are simple dice-rollers and the 1st &amp; 2nd place get prize money. After a couple of races, you draw some more tracks, then race some more and so on.&#10;&#10;The railways cost more if you go over mountains etc, but this gives you shorter routes. You can run parallel to other lines at a cost, or simply link into another player's track and rent the tracks of other players when you race.&#10;&#10;The board has a UK map on one side and a US map on the other, both giving amusing challenges, and the game has good repeat value.

{"id":"462","name":"Esels-Rennen","description":"First issued in 1989 for fewer players, the second edition (released in 1996) is for 2-6 players. The board has two sides, for racing either 3 or 4 colored donkeys. Players are given a card secretly, each showing the donkey's finishing order, a different result for each card. The board shows a patchwork of steps across a field from start to finish, each space with a colored arrow matching the donkeys. When you move a donkey onto a space marked with a green arrow pointing left, you then move the green donkey one space that way. If that space then has a blue arrow pointing right, you next move the blue donkey on one space that way. This goes on until you cannot move the final donkey because it is blocked. Eventually, the donkeys cross the finish line, and the player with the best matching result on their card wins. More of a competitive puzzle than a game, it is a nice diversion, but awkward because the donkeys constantly fall on their sides.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;From the official website:  In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker&mdash;a powerful wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.&#10;&#10;This is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.&#10;&#10;Players build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck.  Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero.  The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.&#10;&#10;An important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are over 25,000 different cards from which to build your deck!&#10;&#10;Cards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect.&#10;&#10;Players randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called &quot;the stack,&quot; provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.&#10;&#10;Though traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CxJmNl4wR4InjqyNrMdBTw__thumb/img/TtlQgYxLTPyYQWJvruMHfwKPReE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic163749.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CxJmNl4wR4InjqyNrMdBTw__original/img/TKQgvl_i6zVYld8Gac8oU-c2ezE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic163749.jpg","yearpublished":"1993","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":2,"minplaytime":20,"maxplaytime":"20","minage":13,"publishers":["Wizards of the Coast"],"designers":["Richard Garfield"],"artists":["Victor Adame","Miao Aili","Randis Albion","Rob Alexander","James Allen (I)","Dave Allsop","Scott Altmann","Ian Edward Ameling","Eric David Anderson","Chris J.

{"id":"464","name":"Billabong","description":"In the geometrical racing game Billabong &mdash; currently available on the market as Billabong Race &mdash; players maneuver teams of kangaroos by jumping around a &quot;billabong&quot;, that is, &quot;a dead-end channel extending from the stream of a river&quot;, with this term being used in Australia. The board is filled with checkerboard-style squares around the billabong in the middle.&#10;&#10;To start, everyone takes turns placing their five kangaroos on an empty square behind the stream that serves as the race's start &mdash; and finish &mdash; line. On your turn, you move one of your five kangaroos, usually moving it in a jump or series of jumps over the other kangaroos. Jumps can be long, but they must take a specific format; for example, if the kangaroo to be jumped over is five spaces away from your current location, your landing space must be five spaces beyond this kangaroo. You can jump over only one kangaroo at a time, but you can make multiple jumps on a turn as long as each jump is along a straight line (whether orthogonally or diagonally) and it does not pass over the billabong. Your other option &mdash; moving a kangaroo just one space &mdash; is usually used as a positioning tactic for a subsequent move.&#10;&#10;The first player to get all five kangaroos around the billabong and over the finish line wins.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TNjX33AzhFkmyyUr0xnZOw__thumb/img/GQbj_3rm9JyXjblBTBA2J0G9HVs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8730609.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TNjX33AzhFkmyyUr0xnZOw__original/img/fAUOGICe-emcZMlhGC6ZgldWbRs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8730609.jpg","yearpublished":"1992","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":10,"publishers":["AMIGO","franjos Spieleverlag","OPEN'N PLAY","Playte","SimplyFun"],"designers":["Eric Solomon"],"artists":["Klemens Franz","Ralf E.

{"id":"466","name":"Inkognito","description":"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The goal of each agent in Inkognito is to complete a mission, together with his partner. At the beginning of the game, however, players don't know which mission they must fulfill!&#10;&#10;In the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When&#31; figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to &quot;ask questions&quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.&#10;&#10;The &#31;first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the &quot;code&quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.&#10;&#10;There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.&#10;&#10;The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W3BGlJsdZO0_MH75qLjStQ__thumb/img/7-RWK99Ojx39mgkZa3MqpxILSR8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3061724.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W3BGlJsdZO0_MH75qLjStQ__original/img/MlR2wxpXBT-hMktt2P7Kgy7kA74=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3061724.jpg","yearpublished":"1988","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":90,"maxplaytime":"90","minage":10,"publishers":["Ares Games","Devir","IELLO","Kaissa Chess & Games","Korea Boardgames","MB Giochi","MB Spellen","MB Spiele","MB spill","Milton Bradley","Oliphante","Paper Iyagi","Piatnik","Planplay","Red Glove","Rio Grande Games","UBO CnC","Venice Connection","Winning Moves Germany"],"designers":["Leo Colovini","Alex Randolph"],"artists":["Peter Gifford","Studio Tapiro"],"rating":6.60848,"weight":2.1616},

Each player's turn consists of rolling dice and moving his devils appropriately, either trying to get to another player's pot, or carrying one back to the kitchen.  If a devil brings milk to the kitchen, it explodes, and the devil carrying it is removed from the game.  A large plastic stove in the middle of the board is the game's exciting gimmick, and comes into play when two opposing devils share the same space and start dueling.

{"id":"470","name":"Road to the White House","description":"extrapolated from the preview:&#10;&#10;The essence of the game is that you are moving from one to four pawns around the country, landing in cities, and scoring &quot;votes&quot; in the appropriate state which are proportional to the size of the city. Each turn, you move and add votes to the states you land in.&#10;&#10;There are many complications that can occur. You can sit out a turn and collect money. With money, you can buy &quot;organization&quot; in a state, acting as a multiplier to all subsequent votes you get in that state. You can buy &quot;advertising&quot; - most useful in buying votes in piddly states that you're too busy to visit. You can buy &quot;surrogates&quot; which are additional pawns who may travel, garnering votes, just like your candidate. You can buy &quot;special flights&quot; that help you get to places without the luck of the dice.&#10;&#10;The most characteristic part of the game comes in the &quot;issues&quot;. Each player picks a politician with his own profile on how he stands on various issues. Then either through choice or chance cards, issues become &quot;active&quot;. As long as the issue is active, politicians with a relevant stand will have bonuses or penalties when he visits certain states. The game strongly encourages role playing.&#10;&#10;The climax of the game comes at the end, as you go down each state to see who has the most votes, thereby winning that state's delegates. There is a smart balloting system, in which the lowest scoring player drops out, giving his states' votes to the next strongest in each state. This continues, with players dropping out in each successive ballot until a winner is chosen.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/K2KqiX_aHkvkQBam3J8GsQ__thumb/img/OFFnqsz0cLvgOrfX2RPrf6YVHLU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic448261.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/K2KqiX_aHkvkQBam3J8GsQ__original/img/vqkqa4KQ-3lvGvvleq-6s68vDR8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic448261.jpg","yearpublished":"1992","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":240,"maxplaytime":"240","minage":12,"publishers":["Mayfair Games"],"designers":["Jim Musser"],"artists":["Bill Sanders"],"rating":6.16687,"weight":3.5455},

The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters.

Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round).

In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square). With Dark City, Citadels supports a maximum of eight players.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/42iW4E-vOumFXRQAiSf-GA__thumb/img/lxwVwqIO1RkDyyykSDFnpmwbgyI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3239104.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/42iW4E-vOumFXRQAiSf-GA__original/img/ochY5pK4sq4vtzkka0OPRwsGLOE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3239104.jpg","yearpublished":"2000","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":8,"minplaytime":20,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":10,"publishers":["Hans im Gl√ºck","999 Games","Arclight Games","Brain Games","cutia.ro","Delta Vision Publishing","E L & M Productions","Edge Entertainment","Enigma (Bergsala Enigma)","Fantasiapelit","Fantasy Flight Games","Fantasy Shop","Galakta","Gal√°pagos Jogos","Giochi Uniti","Hobby World","Houpaa","KADABRA","Kaissa Chess & Games","Korea Boardgames","Laser plus","Midgaard Games","Millenium","MINDOK","MultiSim","Nexus Editrice","Schmidt Spiele","Siam Board Games","Silver Stars Publishing","Smart Ltd","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.","Windrider Games","Z-Man Games","–Ü–≥—Ä–æ–º–∞–≥"],"designers":["Bruno Faidutti"],"artists":["Cyrille Daujean","Julien Delval","Jesper Ejsing","Bruno Faidutti","Didier Graffet","Bjarne Hansen","Darrell Hardy","Florence Magnin","Jean-Louis Mourier","Scott Nicely","Hassan Nozadian","Christian T.

Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players must negotiate and make deals with other players in order to have any success in expanding their borders. They will make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. with two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: it can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold its position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of &quot;orders.&quot; The outcome of the various orders is basically determined by the total strength of the units involved.

Power uses this same general concept, only minus all the devil-inspired backstabbing that makes Diplomacy what it is.  In this game, players are given equal forces consisting of ships, planes and other weapons of modern warfare, including a 'nuke' of sorts.  Each turn, players can move a set number of their pieces based on the chosen piece's movement.  The board is a painfully simple system of orthogonal squares.  Once all moves for a given turn have been written down, all pieces are moved simultaneously.  If more than one force's pieces occupy the same space, then a superiority check is made with each type of piece contributing a set number of strength points (usually inversely related to movement).  The largest force then takes possession of all opposing pieces, making the shift in power quite significant, and the central theme for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/E2LnSHeRGsk2h7yq7Yda1A__thumb/img/mGamV1A4Q_2yizydBgYC5qELorg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic455935.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/E2LnSHeRGsk2h7yq7Yda1A__original/img/qc8FJeFyfU9625-S02gR2dhJiOw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic455935.jpg","yearpublished":"1981","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":10,"publishers":["Power Games International","Spear's Games"],"designers":["Monte B.

Players build up their 'stash piles' by 'patenting' as many 'claims' as possible.

The end game comes when all cards are in the possession of the players, and the stacks are consolidated to determine who has the largest stack of claims.&#10;&#10;The 2-player variant involves repeat-dealing of four cards to players when their hands are exhausted by set collection from the pool until all cards from the deck have been utilized.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by: &#10;&#10;    R&#195;&#164;uber&#10;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DEEIyMgI0Vkubs71wfEAYA__thumb/img/LWvmCNECvPUQ5mCiyQ9b-R-0XWY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic91796.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DEEIyMgI0Vkubs71wfEAYA__original/img/R4aLh_d6b1R3b8C9BbEKzKc62Nk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic91796.jpg","yearpublished":"1985","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":15,"maxplaytime":"15","minage":6,"publishers":["ASS Altenburger Spielkarten","Otto Maier Verlag"],"designers":["Wolfgang Kramer"],"artists":["Richard Anderson","G√ºnther Marks"],"rating":6.00141,"weight":1},

{"id":"494","name":"Ave Caesar","description":"Set in the Roman stadium Circus Maximus, in Ave Caesar, players use cards to move their chariots around a quasi-variable track. The track itself has bottlenecks and lane-changing restrictions, which make the race interesting for the racers (very similar to Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix or Daytona 500). Players are required to race three laps, and they must stop to 'Hail Caesar' before they can finish (a pit stop). The game is light, but if you waste too many moves taking the longer, outside-routes on corners, you may not have enough movement to finish the race. Later, the game was revamped into Ausgebremst, with the most notable changes being modular boards and options to reduce the luck.&#10;&#10;The Cafe Games/Pro Ludo edition has only 2 different tracks compared to the Ravensburger edition with 2 track variants on both sides of the board.&#10;&#10;It was re-released in 2022 by DiceTree Games with deluxe components, new maps, and new variants (by the designer).&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jfsOYuwuwuTwx-2ggixX0g__thumb/img/OVHVl9SyNPlQ8iJNMUfgCYVoyVk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7074363.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jfsOYuwuwuTwx-2ggixX0g__original/img/IjE1UgwAuH-1W01nbOC6yFWwufQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7074363.jpg","yearpublished":"1989","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":12,"publishers":["Asmodee","Cafe Games","DiceTree Games","Grow Jogos e Brinquedos","Japon Brand","Man-indo","M√∂bius Games","Otto Maier Verlag","Pro Ludo","Ravensburger","Êï∞ÂØÑ„Ç≤„Éº„É†„Ç∫ (Suki Games)","Ubik"],"designers":["Wolfgang Riedesser"],"artists":["Ingrid Berner","Eckhard Freytag","Thomas Thiemeyer"],"rating":6.64742,"weight":1.3596},

{"id":"500","name":"MARK","description":"MARK is a game about collecting, processing, and reselling recycled components for a profit. Each turn, a player rolls a pair of color dice and chooses one of the showing die colors to perform an action with. Each color is tied to one type of recyclable material. A player can choose to receive a single new recyclable good to his delivery yard, or he can choose to move a single recyclable good from his delivery yard to his treatment area, or he can choose to sell one good from his treatment area to the market grid in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;The market grid has 5 rows, and each row can hold only one variety of recyclable materials. When selling to the market, if it is the first time that good has been sold, the player may choose which row to sell into (left-most position in the row only), otherwise he must sell into the next empty space in the row that variety already occupies. He receives the amount of money shown on the space where he places his recyclable good. When the row is full, all goods of that type are removed from the game. The game ends when four of the market rows are completely filled.&#10;&#10;If the player rolls both dice of the same color, he has no choice in which recyclable material to choose, but may perform two actions (delivery, treatment, or sale) with that type of good. In addition, there are two special symbols on the dice (one on each). One is a star symbol, which acts as a wild. The player can choose whatever color he desires. The other is a gavel, which triggers an immediate auction for the type of good shown on the other die, after which the player takes another turn. The auction is a closed-fist auction.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the player's turn, he must pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his delivery yard. He must also pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his treatment area. This provides tension between waiting for bigger pay-outs and selling recyclable materials early.&#10;&#10;The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/62jd6ddfkRqIGiSeGHI4SA__thumb/img/rtIu_FI4bM5B7TGE5RohPSfPQgo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3669697.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/62jd6ddfkRqIGiSeGHI4SA__original/img/25cqpirbaF48I8SXPwzhsUmU3NU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3669697.jpg","yearpublished":"1997","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":10,"publishers":["franjos Spieleverlag"],"designers":["Ronald M.

The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy. But for those willing to risk the dangers of the shifting, sun-baked sands, the desert holds riches beyond compare.&#10; In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.&#10; Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe's caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert's oases? Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponents' caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes.&#10;&#10;Through the Desert is part of the so called Knizia tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Rq_hJIAO7jDgIpAW943hJA__thumb/img/blKEV5US-j7v3VDceGF1CIUb-lE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7697747.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Rq_hJIAO7jDgIpAW943hJA__original/img/9lIQGNwBYmAlsgXOI6Iw2Q2CIkA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7697747.jpg","yearpublished":"1998","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":45,"maxplaytime":"45","minage":10,"publishers":["KOSMOS","Allplay","Delta Vision Publishing","Edge Entertainment","Fantasy Flight Games","Galakta","Hobby Japan","Lautapelit.fi","PS-Games","Silver Stars Publishing","Wargames Club Publishing","Z-Man Games"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"artists":["John Gravato","Atha Kanaani","Damien Mammoliti","Scott Nicely","Brian Schomburg","Claus Stephan"],"rating":7.14862,"weight":2.1661},

{"id":"505","name":"Goldener Drache","description":"A clever racing game from Wolfgang Riedesser of Ave Caesar fame.  Players navigate flying dragons from North to South to reach the Golden Volcano.  You start with a set of wind stones marked N, S, O, W, SO, and SW (Ost is German for East).  You get a sloping rack in the shape of a dragon tail and at the start of the game pick the order for your wind stones on your rack, putting one stone underneath your own dragon at its starting position.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you draw the bottom stone from your rack, place it (in the wind direction indicated) next to a dragon on the board, your dragon or another player's, and move the dragon onto your stone.  The stone the dragon had been standing on goes to the top of your rack, to be used again when it rolls down eventually to the bottom.&#10;&#10;You make three moves per turn and try to put the other dragons into tough situations while making progress with your own.  So you generally want to play a North stone to move somebody else and the S, SO, and SW stones for your own dragon -- but there are blocks and corners, so this won't always be possible.&#10;&#10;The main strategic tip is to try to move the dragons that have been left standing on stones with southward movement so as to get the S stones onto your own rack.  You also have two Storm cards (to allow 5 moves instead of 3 on a turn) and two Lightning cards (to prevent another player trying to move your dragon) to deploy during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Although the structural underpinnings and the slight benefit of memory might make you think you're going to have a serious, thinking game, Goldener Drache actually plays out as very light and take-thatty for a fun 15 minutes and &quot;Let's do it again!&quot;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fJ58JMyEq7_lNbl6t3n9hA__thumb/img/22ECC9LpZKCVd9i49J8AF39-1Yc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic294989.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fJ58JMyEq7_lNbl6t3n9hA__original/img/IfazPf1uUwfNKY7C3Ac0Wqnqzl4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic294989.jpg","yearpublished":"1992","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":10,"publishers":["F.X.

This  wargame can be played as a campaign, with new planes becoming available as time passes, and with surviving pilots getting better at what they do.&#10;&#10;Each plane has a maneuver sheet showing which ones it is allowed to do -- some maneuvers can only be executed by ace pilots, and other maneuvers are &quot;restricted&quot; in the sense that they can't be repeated from one turn to the next (the plane would stall).&#10;&#10;If you &quot;tail&quot; another plane, its pilot must show you whether he's going right, left or straight ahead. You get to shoot ahead of your plane, unless you have a bomber with an observer/gunner in the back (swivel-mounted guns). Damage is rolled on a table that determines severity in terms of blue and red hits; you then draw the indicated number of coloued chits from a cup. Hits are taken to the wings, tail, engine, etc. There's a chance the pilot is killed, or that the plane catches fire.&#10;&#10;Fuel eventually runs out and the pilots fly off to meet another day --if they survived. &#10;This is a lot of fun with massive numbers of players; you can put the 20-odd planes on the map at once, balancing the better airplanes with weaker pilots.&#10;&#10;The second edition introduced crude altitude rules, and in 1995 GDW put out full-blown miniatures rules.&#10;&#10;The 2014 edition of Blue Max had substantial changes, and can be found with its own game page HERE.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bpiwU88sDLLYXsnQp-eCnA__thumb/img/eiQdnPLHo9WBKwMTRBexpM6pMYc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic9636.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bpiwU88sDLLYXsnQp-eCnA__original/img/leN2vj2jbC78hUsrFc9uYfuX04U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic9636.jpg","yearpublished":"1983","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":13,"publishers":["Dise√±os Orbitales","Game Designers' Workshop (GDW Games)","Oriflam","Stratelibri"],"designers":["Phil Hall","John Harshman"],"artists":["Thierry Monter","Steve Venters"],"rating":7.17281,"weight":2.2673},

Players hold a hand of cards, each stating a city and day-of-the-week combination.  Their goal is to have the plane reach their destination as close to their card's day as possible.  (E.g. if I hold &quot;Paris - Tuesday&quot; then I'd like the plane to reach Paris on Tuesday, not on Saturday--it's worth more points that way).&#10;&#10;The method by which the plane moves is based on an auction.  Each round, players bid for the right to choose the plane's next destination (each player starts with a fixed amount of money and cannot earn any money during the game).  Movement is restricted to only adjacent cities.  Sometimes a player will receive a windfall when an opponent pays for the privilege of moving the plane but moves it to a place where it's beneficial to both players.  At other times, a player will see the plane start moving away from the area of the world preferred.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all players are out of money or one player has played all of his or her cards.

The main object of the game is to get 10 points, mostly by having your mice get food from the refrigerator back into the mouse-hole. The board is the layout of a house with the mouse-hole on one end and the refrigerator on the other end. Your mice try to get food and your cat tries to stop the other team's mice from doing so. There is a dog counter which can be moved each turn, and you use it to try to go after the opponent's cat. In terms of fighting, you can only fight an enemy (The mouse's enemy is the cat, the dog's enemy is the cat, and the cat's enemies are the mice and the dog). You can also pick up items throughout the house that you can use during combat to modify your strength. If you defeat one of your enemies in combat, it is considered &quot;Clobbered&quot; and cannot function until the next turn. Most items give a strength modifier but some items have special effects. In the basic game, you get 4 points for having your mice get a piece of food back to the mouse-hole, and 1 point when your cat clobbers an opponent's mouse. Optional rules include rules for variable points for the different types of food (cheese, drumstick, apple)&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bkza6NY2quzQZjCbfNEB1Q__thumb/img/Afih6RVGdCYPiYxWPSqvSsjLuUE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1013030.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bkza6NY2quzQZjCbfNEB1Q__original/img/sxJx69jCDz-abxTx6BCUMVXkws0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1013030.jpg","yearpublished":"2000","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":10,"publishers":["Those Darn Games!"],"designers":["Patrick Folan"],"artists":[],"rating":6.14286,"weight":-1},

{"id":"521","name":"Crokinole","description":"Crokinole is a traditional two- or four-player dexterity game, played on a circular wooden board, with 3 rings and an inner recessed 'bullseye'. A ring of posts is set around the inner circle, which functions as an obstacle to reach this area. Playing pieces are wooden circular disks similar to checkers pieces.  Players take turns shooting disks across the board by flicking them with their fingers in an effort to land them in the highest scoring ring on the board, the highest score (20 points) achieved by shooting a disk into the centre, recessed hole. From the outside in, rings are worth 5, 10, 15 points.&#10;&#10;As a traditional game, there are often many variations played, but the following method is based on the National Crokinole Association's rules which also govern the World Crokinole Championship.&#10;&#10;Each disk to be shot must be placed on the outer boundary and within the shooting player's quadrant. If there are no opponent's disks on the board, the shot disk must land in the inner ring or it is removed. If there is an opponent's disk on the board, the shot disk must hit an opponent's piece, either directly, or by bumping another disk into it.  Disks landing in the centre hole are removed and scored at the end of the round. Disks that lie outside--or are touching--the outer boundary after each shot are removed from play for the round.&#10;&#10;The player to score the most points wins the round and scores 2 points, and if a tie, each player scores 1 point. A &quot;game&quot; is usually played to four rounds. The number of &quot;games&quot; in a match is set by the tournament.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, play is to a set score, usually the first player or team to 100, and each round is scored by cancellation. For example if Player One scores 250, and Player Two scores 225, then Player One will add 25 to his/her game score.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DOwZ7_Q1w68iBhARcDAxig__thumb/img/nkY1mEj6fItSXJHctfzFcRIcDT0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8549797.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DOwZ7_Q1w68iBhARcDAxig__original/img/0E7UQ_sXErRusbZVixlIiN8MIJQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8549797.jpg","yearpublished":"1876","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":8,"publishers":["(Public Domain)","(Unknown)","alfaset","BrownCastle Games","Carrom Company","Cogitate Games","Coleco Industries, Inc.","Crokinole World","Felsberger","Ferti","Gameland Ê∏∏ÊàèÂ§ßÈôÜ","Gerhards Spiel und Design","Hilinski Brothers","Industries Prince, Inc.","John Jaques of London","Korea Boardgames","Let's Play Games!

In Reiner Knizia&#039;s first published game, there are nine mine-opening cards and nine mine-closing cards.  To score any points you've got to play gold, silver or copper cards onto the corresponding open mine and then close it.  Trouble is, your opponents can close your mine before you want or even try to steal it with bandit cards -- a tough gauntlet to run, but here and there a few points trickle through and into the scoring column.  On your turn you either play a card OR draw a card -- not both -- making this rapid-fire card game move at its own special pace, which is very quickly indeed.

{"id":"525","name":"Pisa","description":"from Schloesser session report:&#10;&#10;This is a  trick-taking game, but with enough twists to give it a very different feel. Before each hand, players bid, one at a time, to determine three factors which will affect the hand:&#10;&#10;a) trump colors (primary &amp; secondary) &#10;b) most or fewest tricks &#10;c) whether zero is considered 'high' or 'low'&#10;&#10;Bidding is done by playing cards face-down from your hand. Players must bid 1 - 3 three cards on each of these categories. Once all three factors have been determined, players tally the value of the cards they played during this bidding process. The player who played the least value receives 4 (or 5, depending upon the number of players) victory points, with each other player receiving less points depending upon their total. Then, players must discard three of the cards they used in the bidding process, with the remaining cards being returned to their hands. This is usually a tough choice as often the conditions in effect for a particular hand turn out to be different than what you had hoped. This means that many of the cards you played may no longer be useful to you; indeed, they may be a detriment. So, deciding on which cards to keep and which to discard can be tough.&#10;&#10;After this procedure is complete, A standard trick-taking game ensues. Points, however, are rewarded based on whether the goal was to take the most or fewest tricks. The player finishing with the most (or fewest, depending upon which goal was in force) receives 8 points (or 10 of playing with 5 players), the next player gets 6 points and so on down to 2 points. After a hand is completed, the entire process is repeated, including the bidding phase. A number of rounds equal to the number of players is played, with the player accumulating the greatest number of victory points being the victor.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/exg4CeSvLVBw3v3VYu32Kw__thumb/img/ruscY29EGsxbr4kg0MkbV5C3Grg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1193041.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/exg4CeSvLVBw3v3VYu32Kw__original/img/3cQK8f3Bcm-pvxFTJd6A1dhK1KQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1193041.jpg","yearpublished":"1999","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":45,"maxplaytime":"45","minage":12,"publishers":["Adlung-Spiele"],"designers":["G√ºnter Burkhardt"],"artists":[],"rating":6.33977,"weight":1.75},

In this manner, the play space continually shrinks, giving the endgame an almost claustrophobic feel.&#10;&#10;This game is part of project GIPF.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3aBBkCyv1H8nt84n7eGoAw__thumb/img/3S1CTtxI6p-WGai7xvCAS-cdJOM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3140639.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3aBBkCyv1H8nt84n7eGoAw__original/img/yB4pzxo1JfqEycYD6FBt3ym4eFQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3140639.jpg","yearpublished":"1999","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":2,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":9,"publishers":["Don & Co.","HUCH!","Rebel Sp. z o.o.","Rio Grande Games","Schmidt Spiele","Smart Toys and Games, Inc."],"designers":["Kris Burm"],"artists":["Kris Burm","lu'cifer"],"rating":7.26768,"weight":2.7361},
{"id":"529","name":"Charlemagne","description":"This game debuted at Essen 1998 and was a minor hit, considering only three hundred copies were made.  The game was later re-released as the slightly modified Krieg und Frieden (War and Peace) by TM Spiele.  Players are feudal lords that rule their own land and seek to help King Charlemagne build pieces of his castle.  The entire game is made from wood, in a light, clear stain, including the over-sized game board.  Each turn is four seasons, and play continues until all six pieces of the ornate castle are placed.  Players use their resource tiles to bid for that year's agenda, and some resources have more or less value in the bid depending on what type of agenda is available. Then players use their remaining resources to build their lands, sack others' lands, bribe others' knights away from defense, or help to build Charlemagne's castle.  There are slight rules differences between this game and Krieg und Frieden, but mostly a reduction of agenda cards to shorten the game (for the better usually).&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Krieg und Frieden&#10;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OMtGNGr7QcnFIkUPHLVYwA__thumb/img/TEd8IxmM59YLHIErnBSyOWWMCK4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic556.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OMtGNGr7QcnFIkUPHLVYwA__original/img/oq2Z2jILcaaqMwghyxAn84CLJfs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic556.jpg","yearpublished":"1998","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":90,"maxplaytime":"90","minage":10,"publishers":["Think Games"],"designers":["Gerard Mulder"],"artists":["Franz Vohwinkel"],"rating":6.26774,"weight":3},

{"id":"531","name":"Merchants of Amsterdam","description":"Is Merchants of Amsterdam, players are attempting to be in first or second place majorities in a variety of categories throughout the game.  These include commodity markets, trading colonies, and warehouses in Amsterdam.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, that player draws three cards and decides how to resolve them for the turn.  A player can either remove the card from the game, keep it for him or herself, or put it up for auction.  The cards allow players to advance or place one of their markers in the various categories.&#10;&#10;There are also time-marker cards which, when drawn, move the game through various &quot;historical&quot; phases until the last which ends the game.  The historical phases follow a period of time in the history of Amsterdam which can range from no effect, to scoring rounds for particular categories, to bonuses, and towards the end of the game to some penalties as wars begin to disrupt business markets.&#10;&#10;The unique twist in the game is that the game comes with a spring-driven auction clock to perform the Dutch auctions throughout the game.  You start the clock and it ticks down as all of the players hold their hands ready close by.  The idea is that as time passes the cost of the card lowers and it is simply an issue of who will pay for it first by slapping down on the clock and thus stopping it at a certain price.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6-Gt5b4KHTfdVWqPhQCeaw__thumb/img/2c3QxjsDbVlgOsaES-K2gu2ftPU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic153968.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6-Gt5b4KHTfdVWqPhQCeaw__original/img/adj9x4tv6hzBVYGB6YOyLva1flQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic153968.jpg","yearpublished":"2000","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":10,"publishers":["Jumbo","Rio Grande Games"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"artists":[],"rating":6.70737,"weight":2.6339},

{"id":"535","name":"Power Barons","description":"from the general Comment:&#10;This is essentially a card game. Cards come in four basic suits plus a special gray &quot;political power&quot; suit. The cards have values from 5 - 50, with the most cards in the middle of the range. In your turn, you challenge an opponent to a duel in one of the suits. You play a card in any suit (not necessarily the one you are challenging in) , then your opponent plays a card in the same suit. Players can alternately withdraw, or keep going. You then play a different suit - in the same manner, adding up your total score. The suit you challenged in counts double. If the defender withdraws, the challenger places a base (i.e. scores a point) on the defender. If the challenger withdraws, he just finishes his turn without scoring. However, the loser forfeits all cards played (redrawing, but perhaps taking poorer cards), and the winner holds his played cards, and takes the loser's cards into a pool which can score points.&#10;&#10;If no one withdraws after all four suits have been played, players may add gray cards in an attempt to take the lead. Ultimately, a player will pass or run out of gray cards, at which point the high score will win the hand.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KRpRbrPlFw8Q8u9RMnVF5A__thumb/img/rpg32WLmd6xbGdKcdv2EeV2qUGI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic205010.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KRpRbrPlFw8Q8u9RMnVF5A__original/img/vkGWnSTJTfxmpAyO9luxHzAkWzQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic205010.jpg","yearpublished":"1986","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":10,"publishers":["Milton Bradley"],"designers":["(Uncredited)"],"artists":[],"rating":5.52847,"weight":2},

{"id":"538","name":"Manager","description":"Manager is a deceptively simple game of economics for up to six players. Each player is the manager of one of the six companies, which are supposed to be manufacturers competing in the same market with identical products. (It is strongly hinted that the products are computers.) The player is responsible for setting the sale price of his product, buying machines to automate production, and buying or selling stock in any of the six companies.&#10;&#10;The object of each round--usually--is to charge as much as you can for your product without charging too much more than everyone else. Every turn starts with the players secretly setting the price for their product. The person who has charged the least gets to sell. The one who has charged next-to-least also gets to sell--as long as his price wasn't more than 1,000 DM above the person below him. In fact, as long as there isn't a 1,000 DM gap between one player's price and the next, every player gets to sell. But any player who has charged over 1,000 DM more than his next-lowest competitor--and all players who charged more than him--gets locked out of the market.&#10;&#10;The prices on the stock market vary depending on who got to sell and who didn't. The companies that got shut out of the market lose ground. The companies that sold their product gain, with the one who got the highest price gaining the most.&#10;&#10;There is room for all kinds of maneuvering in the game. After the first few rounds, you make more money on the stock market than you do running your company, so you can actually drive your company into the ground--advancing someone else's company--and come out ahead.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/80yrnnKyB7uK2caDxTVamA__thumb/img/xN3Inn6QEo8bdEyIJHM8zyEoXdU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic480629.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/80yrnnKyB7uK2caDxTVamA__original/img/rSoHn0dJF81wy414Kw5Qgtji3JI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic480629.jpg","yearpublished":"1979","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":10,"publishers":["Hexagames (I)","Noris Spiele"],"designers":["Burkhardt M√ºnchhagen","Peter Pfeifer","Waltraud Pfeifer"],"artists":[],"rating":6.39816,"weight":2.5333},

Going in order from first to last, players have a choice of rolling one, two, or three dice.  The first die is a special die with only 1's, 2's and 3's on it, but the other two are normal d6.  The dice may be flipped to the opposite face. Before moving the car, the player must commit to the order that the dice will be used. The dice are then used to move your car.  However, if you use a die for movement in a corner that's not rated for that speed, you'll get a driving error.  Depending on the severity, you might have to journey through pit row on the next lap.  Dice showing 2,3,5 allow the car to move diagonally, or else the car must maintain its lane. There is a drafting mechanism that entails following into specially marked spaces.

Although each word can be used only once - a football and baseball wouldn&rsquo;t count as two BALLS - an object can be used multiple times for different words (e.g., BASEBALL, BALL).  Once time has expired, players read through the lists. Any object on multiple lists scores one point for those who wrote it. Any item unique to a single list scores three points.

Troopers represent the grunts --infantry workhorses and cannon fodder. &quot;Gennies&quot; are Genetically Engineered fighters; they are stronger than Troopers but cannot leave the planet for which they were designed. Transport ships carry troops and factories between planets. War ships come as Fighters and Battlers (i.e., Bombers). Killer Satellites play the role of air defense. Factories make all these pieces - although you do have a Black Market option.&#10;&#10;As the planets move through their orbits you must plan your own moves well in advance to exploit planetary conjunctions. The movement rules consider not only the ship movements in the planet's orbits, but also the respective revolutions of the planets around the sun, and allow players to plan some nice surprises when two planets are near one another, which usually happens only once or twice in the game.&#10;&#10;Upgraded by:&#10;&#10;    Buck Rogers 2.0&#10;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A9I1a17YoMhcHfs_8HsyTA__thumb/img/Gnb575YdouLZwPePx3L_1WSVrLY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic694341.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A9I1a17YoMhcHfs_8HsyTA__original/img/77uVaWRR_YDEF605IVZHo5YKSHo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic694341.jpg","yearpublished":"1988","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":120,"maxplaytime":"120","minage":10,"publishers":["Tactical Studies Rules (TSR)"],"designers":["Jeff Grubb"],"artists":[],"rating":6.48326,"weight":2.6757},
{"id":"549","name":"Aerodrome","description":"Excerpted from a review by Ken Tidwell&#10;&#10;Aerodrome is a miniatures game of aerial combat during World War I. Players take on the role of biplane pilots and tail gunners dog fighting their way through the gray skies of Europe during the war to end all wars. The game is visually appealing and, like many miniatures games, it was easy to project myself into the scenario. The game is played using 1/72 miniature aircraft mounted on radio antennae with a clear acrylic hex base to hold the whole thing upright. The game board is an aerial view of a WWI battlefield marked off in large hexes.&#10;&#10;Pilots and gunners plot out three moves at a time. Each move the pilot chooses from one of eight maneuvers - straight ahead, straight ahead fast, left slip, right slip, right, left, hard right, stall, and Immelman. The slips allow the player to retain their current orientation but slide one hex to the right or left. Ahead fast allows the plane to move two hexes. Ahead, left, right, and hard right allow the plane to change orientation and move one hex in that new direction. An Immelman allows the plane to move forward one hex but completely reverse orientation. A stall allows the plane to stay in its current hex with the current orientation but runs the risk of throwing the plane into a spin. Planes can fly on one of five altitudes. Descent is always possible but planes can generally only ascend when moving forward and trying no wild acrobatics. After movement, pilots may fire on any plane unlucky enough to find itself in their path.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b9OhHQcd-Z2FHm2ikJAUZA__thumb/img/4NX3QfanI_luWg_9WYlQC6cpzlI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic139628.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b9OhHQcd-Z2FHm2ikJAUZA__original/img/BgkvFZ6SpIR0VWR0daaCaQyIQUk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic139628.jpg","yearpublished":"1994","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":12,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":12,"publishers":["(Self-Published)"],"designers":["Stanley Kubiak","Winston J.

{"id":"550","name":"Barbarossa","description":"Barbarossa, in Italian &quot;red beard&quot; was, according to its inventor, inspired by Patricia McKillip's Riddle-Master fantasy trilogy (Die Schule der R&auml;tselmeister in the German translation), in which wizards are devoted to the creation of riddles and riddle solving tournaments. In an interview designer Klaus Teuber stated &quot;As you know there are moments when you close a book really sad that it's over. After finishing the last page, you often feel like you've lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What's the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.&#10;&#10;You make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you're first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points.&#10;&#10;Your objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game. Hopefully the new edition has a better rules set, as players might get puzzled by the variety of actions.&#10;&#10;A later-developed game directly inspired by Barbarossa is  Dominic Crapuchettes' Cluzzle.&#10;&#10;Re-published by Kosmos / Rio Grande 2001.&#10;&#10;Republished by Mayfair Games in 2005, in an edition for a maximum of 4 players in a smaller-sized box.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YwUyWTWnDIcsMsOXR_AnNA__thumb/img/Kmh685vfzSSyljQptV2tfPBsW-I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1152337.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YwUyWTWnDIcsMsOXR_AnNA__original/img/_v0B-tbvabRxWO7xXaHMmx75VnY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1152337.jpg","yearpublished":"1988","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":12,"publishers":["Alga","ASS Altenburger Spielkarten","Catan GmbH","DV Games","KOSMOS","Mayfair Games","New Games Order, LLC","Rio Grande Games"],"designers":["Klaus Teuber"],"artists":["Bildg√•rden AB","Anders Jeppsson","Anke Pohl","Marion Pott","Thilo Rick","Bernd Wagenfeld"],"rating":6.3231,"weight":1.5524},

{"id":"552","name":"Bus","description":"Prior to Essen 1999, a group of students created Splotter Spellen to sell some of their own game designs.  This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.&#10;&#10;Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.&#10;&#10;Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.&#10;&#10;Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if there are no empty streets at one of the ends or the line ends on the crossing as another player's end. All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EI6jGtH3CLqLiI9pfW0pTA__thumb/img/gcj9ymrelp9mdUJRXtqT9Ek0LCk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8179997.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EI6jGtH3CLqLiI9pfW0pTA__original/img/skAAQF86A9wjMElJOXA0EcnJmLE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8179997.jpg","yearpublished":"1999","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":120,"maxplaytime":"120","minage":14,"publishers":["Splotter Spellen","Capstone Games"],"designers":["Jeroen Doumen","Joris Wiersinga"],"artists":["Herman Haverkort","Tamara Jannink","Daan van Paridon","Thijs van Paridon","Joris Wiersinga"],"rating":7.66519,"weight":3.0447},
{"id":"553","name":"Chez Geek","description":"In this light, humorous, and fast-paced card game that parodies geek culture and co-habitation, players are roommates just trying to get through life with as little work as possible.&#10;&#10;At setup each player is dealt a Job card which lists their free time, income, a special ability that they possess and their Slack goal. Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.&#10;&#10;Players take turns as follows:&#10;-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)&#10;&#10;-Make &quot;variable&quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them   the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &quot;uninvited&quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &quot;get rid of&quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).&#10;&#10;-If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &quot;call&quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &quot;uninvited&quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &quot;getting rid of&quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &quot;called&quot;) can also be played in this round.&#10;&#10;-For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)&#10;&#10;-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)&#10;&#10;-Additionally, some Life cards are orange &quot;Whenever&quot; cards which can be played at any time.&#10;&#10;-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.&#10;&#10;The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JhzwjB6QGY3RtuzlIeCAiQ__thumb/img/mw2Ghlxs_ZulyNnkcScvlpnttq0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic263890.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JhzwjB6QGY3RtuzlIeCAiQ__original/img/PJAgxjgfq34Ep4XpFoP-pdeiPSg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic263890.jpg","yearpublished":"1999","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":13,"publishers":["Steve Jackson Games","Edge Entertainment","LocWorks","Pegasus Spiele","Raven Distribution","Ubik"],"designers":["Jon Darbro"],"artists":["Jack Elmy","John Kovalic","Philip Reed"],"rating":5.70459,"weight":1.4205},

{"id":"559","name":"Metro","description":"Similar to Streetcar, Tsuro, Tantrix and Spaghetti Junction, this game has players putting square tiles onto the board to form rail lines. The major difference in this game, however, is that players are not striving to make short, direct routes like those sought in Streetcar. Instead, the object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible.  Players start with a number of trains ringing the board.  Whenever a tile placement connects a train to a station (either on the edge or the center of the board), that train is removed and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses, which can cause one tile to score multiple times if the track loops around.  However, players score double for city connections, which are the stations in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;For those interested in graph theory, a key part of the Metro game design is that the routes will always connect a starting subway train station with an empty destination station, rather than routing to another starting subway train station. The tiles implement a design principle which allows any tile to be placed on any open grid space, subject to rules for alignment with existing tile edges. If correctly placed per the rules, the routing will allow for all trains to score, albeit not necessarily for the high run value the owner would like to attain.&#10;&#10;The game was originally issued as Iron Horse (not to be confused with Iron Horse).&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Cable Car&#10;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kQDUq7v6SaBSXLRSTd4eww__thumb/img/apHRx-TQooSGfv9uVKEX-HGDjfU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3389098.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kQDUq7v6SaBSXLRSTd4eww__original/img/pFxwwuIj2zAZtFcOb29zHXjDw-Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3389098.jpg","yearpublished":"1997","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":8,"publishers":["Queen Games","Calamity Games","Corfix","db-Spiele","Devir","G3","Piatnik","√úberplay"],"designers":["Dirk Henn"],"artists":["Barbara Henn","Franz Vohwinkel"],"rating":6.36616,"weight":1.6839},

High score when all the contracts are gone wins, but usually someone wins before that happens by hitting 600 points.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/J3hV-N_nPlPNhT0-CqTBCQ__thumb/img/_v4xkPyArbqaEml8AXwDJLVaDNQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic11286.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/J3hV-N_nPlPNhT0-CqTBCQ__original/img/DNGH8sM2-tgoj1dZXGWe0OGzy7U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic11286.jpg","yearpublished":"2000","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":10,"publishers":["Queen Games"],"designers":["Gerd Deininger","Andreas Michaelis"],"artists":["Franz Vohwinkel"],"rating":6.40423,"weight":2.5128},

Yet, the precious cargo he brought with him, convinced even the most discriminating and suspicious among the Venezians.&#10;&#10;Everyone wanted to have some of the valuable goods from China. Through the Silk Road &mdash; the legendary trading route which connected China with Europe &mdash;  traders brought exquisite treasures home, most importantly, precious silk,  which no one outside of China knew how to make.&#10;&#10;But the road which led to Venezia through the Gobi desert and passing the great commercial centers of Xi'an, Samarkand, Buchara, Bagdad and Byzanz, was dangerous. This made the traders dependent on each other during the journey. Nevertheless this did not stop them from, using the right tactics and a trace of cunning, trying to gain advantages over each other. Especially in the Bazaars and at the large Trading Posts which lined the route. The first to arrive would make the most profitable deals and receive the most ounces of Silver when they arrived at the end of their trip.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/t2zEtV5WnLBJRk3ZjZd-qA__thumb/img/8JpUK-B-AVUYr89MGSq7mH0bzlc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5614509.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/t2zEtV5WnLBJRk3ZjZd-qA__original/img/e2GU-a9WWLAbLapQjuucvJF2qro=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5614509.jpg","yearpublished":"1998","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":7,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":10,"publishers":["Schmidt Spiele"],"designers":["Hartmut Kommerell"],"artists":[],"rating":5.51474,"weight":1.7778},

Players each sequentially pick the top card which has the action they'd like to take.  These actions revolve around placing of control markers on the board.  There are three types of control markers that are available, and each type of marker will score each time the area is scored.  The areas are scored when either the Ancestor or the Elder tokens appear in the area, and moving either of the tokens gives the moving player the first-player status or extra scoring cards.  The scoring cards are the last element, as once an area is scored the players involved in the area use these cards to manipulate control makers in the general vicinity.

Let 's hope that you have better cards than your opponents!&#10;&#10;Two teams of two or three players compete with the aim to open as many pubs as they can.

They can also cause other inconveniences like influenza for the personnel of the other team, pipe bursts or denial of credit. The other team can defend themselves with their own hooligans, managers or the two doormen Gaston and Gustave. Both, developing / opening of pubs and getting rid of the competitors, gain points. You have, for example, destroyed the other teams disco. Not only do the others not score points with their disco if you call a disco your own, their customers come to your premises (where else could they dance?)  and you collect MONEY (points)!!

{"id":"574","name":"Devil Take the Hindmost","description":"In this clever racing game, cars move around a 30-space track on which the spaces are numbered from 1 to 10, then 1 to 10 again, then 1 to 10 for a third time.  The cards have different powers depending on which number your car is sitting on.  For instance, a card might move you 8 spaces if you're sitting on an 8, but only 3 spaces otherwise.  Cards go in and out of your hand at a rapid rate as you play and discard your way through a series of races, and card management skills will come in handy if you've got them.  Each race goes by quite quickly, but the game consists of a whole series of races -- 11 if you play with the full complement of 3 cars each for 4 players or 2 cars each for 6 -- the gimmick being that, at the end of each race, the car that came in last is removed from the game, and the next race has one fewer starters -- and so on until the game is down to the last two cars and the last race for the ultimate victory.&#10;&#10;Originally released as Devil takes the Hindmost which has the same mechanics but is a cycling-racing game.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nZQ0ioqiKOFBqmH6TzML1g__thumb/img/8V5M_rrefEBkXY78RMgqBvNWSro=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic188812.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nZQ0ioqiKOFBqmH6TzML1g__original/img/7G1TJEXe-pI2t203J6BX9ALBQDw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic188812.jpg","yearpublished":"1991","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":8,"publishers":["Fiendish Board Games","franjos Spieleverlag","Lambourne Games"],"designers":["Terry Goodchild"],"artists":["Franz-Josef Schulte"],"rating":6.42025,"weight":1.5135},

If you match him in round 3, you get 200 euro from him for the two card match, &#10;400 euro for the different suit match, and 500 euro for the three card match.&#10;&#10;Everyone gets to be the Show-Off one time (or more with fewer players).&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lldBtVz8jgGA5D5rTuRuNQ__thumb/img/gxVVc20qAoyTYFAM3XEOHYM-rP8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic250787.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lldBtVz8jgGA5D5rTuRuNQ__original/img/7tWGjTvU4wpBsQ9QuFBeh93eP34=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic250787.jpg","yearpublished":"2000","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":8,"publishers":["Schmidt Spiele"],"designers":["J√ºrgen P.

{"id":"586","name":"Up Front","description":"Only once in a great while does a game dare to be truly different and abandon old concepts while striking out to chart virgin territory in game design. Rarer still are the instances in which these games succeed in presenting a simulation of unparalleled realism in an easily comprehended and playable format. In UP FRONT, we have just such a game. Gone are the hexes and charts of conventional wargames; replaced by innovative and attractive game components which have distilled a wealth of technical data into one of the most playable, yet detail laden formats ever devised.&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is a game of man-to-man infantry combat set in WWII Europe. In many ways, the game is more realistic than SQUAD LEADER principles in that its inherent mechanics simulate the fear and confusion of the battlefield and the inability of leadership to assert itself far better than any tactical combat game yet published. There is no playing board; it has been replaced by Terrain cards which become the &ldquo;hexagons&rdquo; of the game as players maneuver their forces via Action cards over constantly changing terrain. The scale of the game is measured in terms of relative ranges between opposing forces, with most combat occurring within a scale distance of 500 meters during the course of player turns measured in varying seconds of actual time.&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is a game player&rsquo;s game, rich in detail yet easily playable within the space of a lunch hour. However, it also contains engrossing Multi-Player and Campaign Game versions which could last a week or more. Like SQUAD LEADER, UP FRONT is an open-ended game capable of depicting endless Design-Your-Own variations of small unit actions between American, German and Russian combatants. Tanks, Assault Guns, Smoke, Anti-Tank Rifles, Demolition Charges, Pillboxes, Partisans, SS, Entrenchments, Anti-Tank Mines, Infantry Guns, Flamethrowers, Armoured Cars, Halftracks, Panzerfausts, Bazookas, Panzerschrecks, Wire, Ambushes, Radios, Artillery, Minefields, Mortars, Snipers, Starshells, Heroes, Prisoners and Fords are all accounted for. In fact, UP FRONT encompasses almost everything that the SQUAD LEADER game system has taken four gamettes to do, and does so in a far more playable format. The game can be summed up in four words: Innovation, playability, detail and realism. That&rsquo;s an unbeatable combination.&#10;&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is rated 4 on the Avalon Hill Complexity scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (difficult).&#10;&#10;Recommended for two or more discriminating players of skill, ages 12 &amp; up.&#10;&#10;Each game includes: &#10;&#10;     162 full-colour, quality 2&frac14;&quot; &times; 3 &frac12;&quot; playing cards&#10;     120 full-colour 2&quot; &times; 2.6&quot; infantry cards&#10;     40 full-colour 2.3&quot; &times; 3.1&quot; AFV cards (maybe 39 cards?

{"id":"592","name":"Spades","description":"This trick-taking game is a standard deck playing card game and takes on many different group-specific rules.  Generally speaking, each player is given thirteen cards and a partner who sits across the table.  Each player bids the number of tricks they'll take, and then the partners collectively attempt to take at least as many as they bid.  The tricks are fairly standard with following suit if you can, and spades as the trump suit.  If you make your bid you earn ten times the number of tricks you bid, otherwise you lose that many points.  Plus there is usually a nil bid, which means you personally won't take any tricks but your partner still plays as normal.&#10;&#10;Call Break is a popular variation of Spades among card game players in South Asian countries. To win, players must score the maximum points in 5 rounds. Points equal the number of tricks bid in each hand. The player who wins that hand gains point, the loser loses the same amount of points.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hP26HZHWGKFmbmmPktaXWQ__thumb/img/ggufZoZyFOBgE9q-LHLStvNwE3g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1977642.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hP26HZHWGKFmbmmPktaXWQ__original/img/E-yW1amX-Ycjy_U3562X74Kcm4o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1977642.jpg","yearpublished":"1938","minplayers":4,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":10,"publishers":["(Public Domain)","Fundex"],"designers":["(Uncredited)"],"artists":[],"rating":6.79661,"weight":2.0275},
{"id":"593","name":"Favoriten","description":"Favoriten is a simple betting/race game with a nifty element of press-your-luck thrown in.&#10;&#10;Five horses are involved in each of three races.  Players do not own any horse.  Rather, they each have three betting chips.  On a player's turn, she/he rolls a die and moves one of the five horses forward based on the result of the roll.  The race track pictured on the board has two lanes.  These lanes are used by the player to keep track of which horses have been moved in the current turn. At the start of a turn all of the horses shall be in the same lane. Then as a player moves the horses forward, he/she also moves them to the other lane. The player continues until they've rolled five times and moved each horse once.  The lane from where the horses started the turn will be empty.&#10;&#10;That's simple enough.  But before each turn, players are allowed to place a bet on a horse (starting with the rolling player).  After a person places a bet (e.g. &quot;I'll back the green horse&quot;) the next player can choose to or not to place a bet.  This continues until all players decline to place a betting chip.  Then the player starts rolling and moving horses.&#10;&#10;Eventually, three horses will cross the finish line and will pay out for win, place, or show positions.  The player who first placed a bet on the winning horse claims the greatest payoff.  Payoffs diminish the longer a player waited to support a horse (e.g. the second person to bet on the horse that ultimately wins pays less than the first player to back the second-place horse).&#10;&#10;The constant wait-and-see is agonizing.  If you back an unpopular horse, you'll watch it lag behind.  If you wait until everyone else is pushing a particular horse, you gain very little for joining the bandwagon late in the game.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gN0kEaSXukRXRLiQSxaWxQ__thumb/img/xUoqTTuBCkJJ5fJTeZY2y8Z4FW0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic184258.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gN0kEaSXukRXRLiQSxaWxQ__original/img/vEWRPRs_lMPj5RC4CaVAlOTA6yg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic184258.jpg","yearpublished":"1989","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":60,"maxplaytime":"60","minage":9,"publishers":["Walter M√ºller's Spielewerkstatt"],"designers":["Walter M√ºller"],"artists":["Wolfgang Steinmeyer"],"rating":6.41249,"weight":1.3333},
{"id":"594","name":"Sleuth","description":"In Sleuth, a classic deduction game from master designer Sid Sackson originally released as part of the 3M Gamette Series, players are searching for a hidden gem, one of 36 gem cards hidden before the start of the game. The remainder of this gem deck &ndash; with each card showing 1-3 diamonds, pearls or opals in one of four colors &ndash; is distributed evenly among the players, with any remaining cards laid face up. Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing.&#10;&#10;A second deck contains 54 search cards, each showing one or two elements, such as diamonds, pairs, blue opals, red pearls, or an element of your choice. Each player receives four face-up search cards; on a turn, you choose one of those cards and ask an opponent how many gem cards they have of the type shown. If you ask for, say, pairs, the player must tell you how many pairs they hold but not which specific pairs; if you ask for something more specific, say, red diamonds, the player reveals to everyone how many such cards she holds while you get to look at them in secret.&#10;&#10;Players track information on a score pad. You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card. If you're wrong, you keep playing but can only answer questions; if you're correct, you win.&#10;&#10;The simplicity of the rules and the cards belies the complexity of the game. In some cases you see cards, while in others you hear only the number of cards that an opponent holds, making it tough to deduce.

It is played with a deck which is basically two standard decks of cards with some interesting variations on suits and the four Jokers thrown in. To start, each player is dealt four cards which form the basis for four stacks. The goal is to have each stack sum to 21 points. Any stack which sums to greater than 21 points is immediately tossed out. Any stack that sums to less is still in play. Only stacks that sum to 21 score. When all stacks have either scored or blown, the round is over.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ysi0Ad_Ohk6KNBKq7ZnaAw__thumb/img/zbm9t6Ss_-Lb8TqT5T2c5QGAxqM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic37000.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ysi0Ad_Ohk6KNBKq7ZnaAw__original/img/HbJMpmjb_dsJMZsl6cGomZ5lL4A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic37000.jpg","yearpublished":"1997","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":8,"publishers":["Enginuity"],"designers":["Andy Daniel"],"artists":[],"rating":3.6,"weight":1},

{"id":"606","name":"Pico 2","description":"from game review:&#10;&#10;The  game is composed of 11 cards. These are numbered 4 through 13 plus 16 and each also bears a number of &quot;pips&quot;. (From one on the 4 card to four on the 16 card.) A round is played as follows: each player is dealt 5 cards with the eleventh card discarded face-up. (Note that this means that you know exactly what cards your opponent holds.) Each turn both you and your opponent secretly select one of their respective cards and reveal them simultaneously. The higher card wins and that player sets that card aside scoring the number of pips on it. The loser retains his/her played card. However, if the higher card is more than twice the lower card then it's the lower card that is placed aside and scored. So the 13 will beat the 10 but lose to the 6. Play continues until one player is left with but a single card. Points are then scored and, here's the clever bit, players swap hands and do it again. This ensures that each game is exactly fair as both players will have equal opportunity to play a strong/weak hand. After these two rounds the points are totaled and a winner declared. There are, at most, fourteen card plays in a game and so the game is usually over in two or three minutes.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2vyJdasg6kgdfm-gfpVqHQ__thumb/img/NINN5q1YPhJS0veAignkQMXrTI8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic618921.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2vyJdasg6kgdfm-gfpVqHQ__original/img/VjH-P7SQVG6BUEjEHI0hp40Qa7s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic618921.jpg","yearpublished":"1997","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":2,"minplaytime":5,"maxplaytime":"5","minage":10,"publishers":["Doris & Frank"],"designers":["Doris Matth√§us","Frank Nestel"],"artists":["Doris Matth√§us"],"rating":5.89653,"weight":1.1515},

{"id":"609","name":"Ferkelei","description":"Players do essentially two things in Ferkelei: Shift their portfolios of stock in show pigs, and play cards to award prize money to pigs (or cause them to lose money or not to win). Many stock-based games have these features, but this game has a significant bandwagon effect. As one color of pig became active, many players would accumulate its stock, and the stockholders would naturally do things that helped each other, without forming explicit alliances. Then the color would play out, or other players would quash it or play the negative pig, and the game would move on to another color. The effect is like successive waves of popularity being washed out or dashed.&#10;&#10;More about the mechanics for those who are interested: On each turn, the player may exchange one stock chip for another or buy one. (At the start, nobody has cash to buy, so they only have their initial two chips available for exchange.) Then the player plays as many cards of one color as they like (from zero to five, except zero is not allowed if one has five or the draw pile is empty). Playing the cards can cover up competing pigs and/or bring one's favored pig to the fore, awarding it prizes depending on how far it has reached and how many times it appears on the board.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Merchants, with a number of changes&#10;&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OCYKEHXnY_kKbSHUaaHJZQ__thumb/img/nT6IYAu-xUWSLO6LcnJg4sdzurc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5238672.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OCYKEHXnY_kKbSHUaaHJZQ__original/img/iXg0kUM8cpmm1fjOezjmvgCK4RM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5238672.jpg","yearpublished":"1995","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":45,"maxplaytime":"45","minage":8,"publishers":["Schmidt Spiele"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"artists":[],"rating":5.67241,"weight":1.6667},
{"id":"610","name":"Knights of the Rainbow","description":"Knights of the Rainbow is from FX Schmid USA. The box rates the game for 2-6, the rules rate it for 2-4, and the body of the rules refer to a maximum of five players. It is recommended that players stay within the 2-4 range, where 3 players seems ideal, otherwise the benefits of the honor cards (see below) are far too strong.&#10;&#10;Players start with seven strength, two gold, and no cards. On each turn a player can flip one, two, or three cards from the deck, keeping one of them and discarding the rest. All of a player&rsquo;s cards are kept face-up, stacked by type so everyone can see them.&#10;&#10;Players win by knocking out all opponents or having the highest score after three passes through the deck. Most of the cards are distributed among five color-coded types: strength, force, gold, magic, and honor. The player with the most cards of each type gains an advantage, usually at the start of his turn. The simplest of these increase a player&rsquo;s strength or gold, or decrease other players&rsquo; strength. The leader in magic can trade any of his cards for any card from the discard pile, or sacrifice any one of his own cards to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s card.&#10;&#10;Honor works differently. Shuffled into the deck are four &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Favor&rdquo; cards. When one of these is turned up, the player with the most honor gets two gold, two strength, or the top card from the deck. Misfortune cards are the dark side of the same coin, forcing loss of gold, strength, or cards from all players. Many cards bear a rainbow icon, however, and the player showing the most rainbows at the top of their stacks is protected from Misfortune.&#10;&#10;A player can spend gold at the end of his turn to buy another card from the deck, decrease an opponent&rsquo;s strength, or trade cards with an opponent. A player losing his last strength is knocked out of the game. Anyone who survives to the third appearance of the Long Live the King card (which triggers a reshuffle) scores a point for each magic card, strength, and gold they have. The highest total wins.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QnmN2T9JZtgS5Eu2gzlAhA__thumb/img/pC5wauJh3pqkFI7MmgBAzsvq9FI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic48675.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QnmN2T9JZtgS5Eu2gzlAhA__original/img/x2VwR3VJId_e7H7OEPXysFltX_A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic48675.jpg","yearpublished":"1999","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"45","minage":10,"publishers":["F.X.

{"id":"611","name":"Ironman Football","description":"Ironman Football is a team management game based on gridiron football in the early 1920's. That was a time when there were no TV million$, no real passing game as they played with a squashed medicine ball, shoulder padding was a sturdy arrant jumper, helmets were strictly optional and you were expected to play on both offense and defense.&#10;&#10;The game features such notable institutions as the Pottsville Maroons, the Dayton Triangles and the Frankford Yellowjackets, and mega stars like Red Grange, George Halas, Jim Thorpe and Paul Robeson.&#10;        &#10;The game works on the old system of pulling a team together, playing a series of games, whacking down some event cards and trying to obtain the best record to win the league.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game you are handed some event cards, a league franchise, a team name and, unless you are very unlucky, a handful of star players. You also get some money.   Your core players, the poor faceless grunts in the trenches, are abstracted into a simple team rating and a total salary bill (excellent idea) but the star players, the backs and ends, are each given their own individual card. As team manager, it is your job to balance the huge benefits of having these talented individuals on your staff with the interestingly high salaries they demand for performance.&#10;&#10;The three key areas of offense, defense and special teams can all be enhanced by the star cards.&#10;&#10;In addition to the player-controlled teams, who will usually play each other twice, the game also supplies a range of 'autopilot' opponents. There are league teams who are often as good, or even better, than the players' lineups and also sandlot teams.&#10;&#10;Event cards add a lot to almost any the game. They can be played either before your weekly scheduled game or during the game itself. Their effects are wide ranging; from new gadget plays that can give you an extra dice on offense, to sponsorship deals that enable you to sell out to local government for big money. There are college players, fan loyalty, rain insurance, scams, scandals, intrigue and even subtle stuff like players' agents, loyalty and defections.&#10;&#10;Once you have played the game, you work out the gate receipts, which are divided between the home team and the visitors based on a pre-agreed percentage split. There are variables such as number of star players on show, rain, home opener, whether you are playing a winning team, etc. As it is more profitable to be at home (no travel expenses) and to play the winning teams with the most star players, each team has an inherent draw factor - remember this is pre-TV - and can negotiate and earn high income accordingly. Want to play the top rated Canton Bulldogs (8-0-2, three star players) at home? You are going to have to offer their boss a healthy enticement to come to Oolong and perform against your 0-5 Indians, just to earn some money to pay off your overdraft.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, having pocketed your share of the take, you must pay all the players their salaries and if you can't meet the payroll, you will start to lose staff. They may stay on out of the goodness of their hearts, but you also need to apply to the league for a stay of financial execution and avoid bankruptcy. All this links into the league structure. If you have any sort of claim against your opponent you may appeal and have your rival reprimanded or fined, and always at the back of your mind is simply surviving game to game. You must maintain a winning record, you need to find new players to satisfy the butcher's bill of game injuries and, if you survive all that and play nine games well, you'll get a shot at the league title. Interestingly, the game can be won by other means than just having the best record. The team with the most money also gets a point, and a winning season will accrue another. It is unlikely that with a title win you'll lose, but there will be teams close on your tail.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GoG2cJyNZiVqidqMcxqGwA__thumb/img/q0mRHt1LhQyobkNYKG1dfa8k1uU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic136055.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GoG2cJyNZiVqidqMcxqGwA__original/img/C3a-6sc15QWlxF1IBhGVkp_IvNg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic136055.jpg","yearpublished":"1995","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":8,"minplaytime":180,"maxplaytime":"180","minage":10,"publishers":["Simulations Workshop"],"designers":["Randy Moorehead"],"artists":[],"rating":6.33511,"weight":2.25},

Beginning with the player who selected the object card, in as many rounds as needed. Bids must increase by 1000 or a multiple thereof. Once a player passes, he may not re-enter this auction.&#10;&#10;The highest bidder pays the bank and receives the object card. The player may make change with the bank. The card will have 3 objects on it. The purchaser now has to distribute each of those objects.&#10;&#10;Three possibilities  exist for the card, each of the three objects on the card are used one at a time in any sequence desired.&#10;&#10;The sequence is decided by the player who paid for the card. Each item is released after it is used:&#10;&#10;1. An object for which he has only 0-2 copies in his collection: in this case he must take the object into his own collection. He sets one mark on the first field of the item or shifts it to the right to the next field. If this is the third type of an item, he immediately receives a bonus of 30000 from the bank.&#10;&#10;2. An object for which he already 3 or more copies in its collection. In this case he sells the object to any fellow player who has from 0-4 copies of the object in his collection. The fellow player cannot reject the purchase and must pay the seller 20000. The buyer moves his marker to the appropriate field. If this causes the marker to move to the third position, he should immediately receive a bonus of 30,000 marks from the bank.&#10;&#10;Note: the fourth and fifth objects of a type are thus always sold; one never receives these two objects from an object card that they have won for auction.&#10;&#10;Buying more than 3 types of art makes ones collection decrease in value.

In this case, the auction winner sells such objects - as under 2 as described  to other players&#10;&#10;The object card is placed face up in the second side of the card holder after its 3 objects are distributed among the players.&#10;&#10;The top face down card is turned up and added to the remaining 4 face up cards.&#10;&#10;The player who purchased the last card, selects the next card to auction.&#10;&#10;The game ends the moment one of the players goes broke.&#10;&#10;First the fellow player is paid off, then the bank and then buyer receives any possible bonus.&#10;The winner is the player who has the most cash.

{"id":"619","name":"The Bottle Imp","description":"In this trick-taking game based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson of the same name, the goal is to gain the most points over a series of hands (usually the goal is set to 200 pts). Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the &quot;price of the bottle.&quot;&#10;&#10;The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered &quot;trump&quot; and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).&#10;&#10;Cards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.  Play continues until the point goal is reached.&#10;&#10;In the 2003 edition the complete story by R.L. Stevenson http://gaslight.mtroyal.ab.ca/bottlimp.htm is included (in both English &amp; German) and the bottle is a nice wooden piece.  Earlier versions had a stand-up cardboard piece that you cut out.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_8ZkzNmVVQDrmJT8es4MBQ__thumb/img/E5plj7g273UcROzmWPPrMlieZK4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3715687.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_8ZkzNmVVQDrmJT8es4MBQ__original/img/WeQ1ltabbnAg6Wvpr93dI8L3wXI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3715687.jpg","yearpublished":"1995","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":10,"publishers":["Bambus Spieleverlag","Lautapelit.fi","Mandoo Games","Mont T√†ber","Playagame Edizioni","PopcornEdu","Stronghold Games","Êï∞ÂØÑ„Ç≤„Éº„É†„Ç∫ (Suki Games)","University Games","Z-Man Games"],"designers":["G√ºnter Cornett"],"artists":["Tom Agnetti","G√ºnter Cornett","Carsten Fuhrmann","Tuuli Hyp√©n","Jere Kasanen","Rok Kim"],"rating":6.73883,"weight":1.8659},
{"id":"620","name":"We the People","description":"We the People was the first in what has become a very popular trend for wargaming.  The typically hex-based maps were simplified into an abstract system of connected spaces, which are used for army movement and to keep track of who controls the provinces politically.  The armies themselves are greatly simplified, but the general in charge of the army gains much importance through his ratings for combat effectiveness and overall strategic effectiveness.  Typically, dice are used to resolve conflicts between troops, however a deck of battle cards are used instead, which captures the feel of conflict much better and gives approximately the same results seemingly without the bitterness that accompanies skewed die rolls.  And lastly, the overall ebb and flow of the game is determined through the play of strategy cards, which ostensibly mark certain historical events during the Revolutionary War, but each card has multiple purposes depending on which side is attempting to use it.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/59LunitQtWv2MyY8FZsbuQ__thumb/img/5SxNwbZ2FP7Zj0Jc2kwzpdGRBPw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic289191.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/59LunitQtWv2MyY8FZsbuQ__original/img/eBIGSKqnZ96s3TLova-OMw3EypE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic289191.jpg","yearpublished":"1993","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":2,"minplaytime":120,"maxplaytime":"120","minage":12,"publishers":["The Avalon Hill Game Co"],"designers":["Mark Herman"],"artists":["Stephen Langmead","William B.

{"id":"629","name":"Q-Turn","description":"Q-Turn is a fast and unpredictable little game played on a dynamic board made up of 16 wooden nickels. The game is packaged very efficiently, in a small clear plastic tube, along with a rules sheet and four small flat tokens. Q-Turn is thus highly portable, and can be played on any flat surface, from the lunch counter to an airline tray table.&#10;&#10;The game is played by randomizing the disks and placing them face down on the table in a 4x4 pattern. Tokens are placed at the corners, with the goal being to move your token to the opposite corner and back again before your opponents. As the tokens move across the board, disks are flipped over, revealing arrows that indicate which way a token may move next. Each type of disk allows a different special action, rotating one or all of the disks a quarter turn, thus changing the available paths across the board.&#10;&#10;A quarter-turn here, and a quarter-turn there, and soon everyone may be headed off in the wrong direction!&#10;&#10;Microbadge&#10;&#10; Buy It&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Vt_YNmMEFo5nvp5HdLWyXQ__thumb/img/7WkfAS-Y2z9SFl0_gPMD0Ecn6CU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2931.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Vt_YNmMEFo5nvp5HdLWyXQ__original/img/n5n5-wHNNxbivmCiVY6jxYgT5s0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2931.jpg","yearpublished":"1999","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":20,"maxplaytime":"20","minage":8,"publishers":["Looney Labs"],"designers":["Andrew Looney"],"artists":["Alison Frane"],"rating":5.05521,"weight":1.2308},

In the curves, the track narrows to two lanes.  The outer lane is a passing lane, requiring twice as many movement points to use and in which a car may not end its turn.  Movement points come from play of the special deck of cards.  Selecting a card from your hand, you move each of the cars on the card the prescribed number of spaces, trying to position your own car or cars most advantageously while leaving your opponents blocked.  Before each race, the six cars are auctioned off, and you bid for them based on the cards in your hand.  Payout is based on where your car(s) finished in the race.

Should you jump out to save your points or trust that the pilot will take you safely higher?&#10;&#10;Everyone places their passenger token into the balloon's basket to start the trip, and receives a hand of six balloon cards. Then, each turn, a different &quot;pilot&quot; rolls an increasing number of specialized dice to see if the balloon can stay aloft. The dice dictate how many of the balloon cards are needed of each color. (There are also optionally played Wild Cards to keep everyone guessing.) Each player decides whether they think the pilot will have the cards to successfully take the balloon up, or whether they should jump out and keep the points earned so far. If they stay, they run the risk of getting no points if the pilot fails. If the balloon does fall, it is placed back on the lowest cloud. Everyone hops aboard and draws one new card, and the next trip begins.

{"id":"636","name":"Blindside","description":"A Nomination Whist variant that is played with an odd deck of cards. The deck contains the four regular suits, but each has 2 Kings, 2 Queens and 3 Jacks, 3 '10's and 3 '9's. There are also four jokers, which &#10;count as the highest trump. At the end of each hand, the players score a point for each trick made, with a&#10;bonus of ten if you make exactly as many tricks as you bid. If you bid zero and made no tricks, you score&#10;20 points - which makes zero very valuable. The game ends when any player reaches 77 points at the end&#10;of a hand: the player with the most points wins.  Each hand starts with dealing out the entire deck. Each&#10;player uses one face down card as a bid for the trump suit.  If one suit has more cards than any other,&#10;this suit becomes trumps for the hand. If not, the hand is played as No Trumps. There is a clear trade-off&#10;here between getting the suit you want as trumps and retaining as many cards as possible in the suit.&#10;However, it can also be a useful way of reducing your holding in a particular suit. Or even throwing away &#10;a high card that would otherwise win a trick, if you are going to bid zero tricks.  Once the trump suit has &#10;been determined, each player, starting to the left of dealer, states how many tricks they expect to take.&#10;This gives an interesting advantage to the dealer.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NRu2NTaectKhKunFByV08w__thumb/img/xrjLyt_IlR_bvn1_r7-8R9FfeHc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic45148.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NRu2NTaectKhKunFByV08w__original/img/aEIWDrPBXwVrVJ1jJhRoI_OJ2AY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic45148.jpg","yearpublished":"1998","minplayers":4,"maxplayers":4,"minplaytime":-1,"maxplaytime":"0","minage":-1,"publishers":["Hangman Games"],"designers":["Alan D.

{"id":"639","name":"American Megafauna","description":"From the designer/publisher:&#10;&#10;A quarter of a billion years ago, an unknown catastrophe engulfs the Earth. The swamps and ice caps of the Permian are replaced by the blistering deserts of the Triassic. On both land and sea, 96% of the animal species die.&#10;&#10;In the corner of Pangea that will be known as America, small survivors cautiously sniff the post-holocaust air at the dawn of the Mesozoic Era. Some of these unspecialized  quadrupeds have sloppy ever-replacing reptile teeth, these will be the dinosaurs. Others have sculpted &quot;one-shot&quot; teeth, these will be the mammals. The victor in this titanic  ecological struggle will determine the masters of the planet.&#10;&#10;Clearly, the ruling reptiles triumphed since that day, 248 million years ago, and dominated for 170 million years. Only to be overthrown, in what must be the upset of the eon, by the  mammals. Yet the contest is not over.&#10;&#10;American Megafauna pits dinosaurs against mammals in ancient America. The game is designed for two to four players, from  ages 9 to adult, or can be played solitaire. It recreates the titanic contest of these two types of prehistoric beasts from the  Triassic to the present.&#10;&#10;This is a game of ecology, evolution, and DNA. Players start as one of four nondescript archetypes, but can branch out to new species from this basic type by bidding on genotype and DNA cards as they are revealed. For auction &quot;currency,&quot; players use  gene coins from a &quot;gene pool.&quot; DNA cards allow players to create strange animals, from cud-chewing crocodiles with antlers, to  saber-tooth meat-eating camels.&#10;&#10;In the advanced version, the continent of Laurentia is occasionally flooded or glaciated; greenhouse levels change; and the three Milankovich cycles are handled by cards that occur with historical probabilities.

{"id":"644","name":"Shipwrecked","description":"You are Shipwrecked... to survive, you must compete head-to-head in a bid for food, shelter, water, and friends. These entertaining contests require strategy, intuition, and nerve to determine who survives and who doesn't.&#10;   &#10;This is an auction bidding game. Each round, the lead off player flips over a card from the deck which will then be auctioned off. There are also Hidden Resource cards in the deck. When one comes up, players bid for the next card in the deck without knowing what it is!  Each player has 6 bid markers: 3 Pass, 2 Stop, and 1 Strike. Each round of each auction, a player must place one of these markers face down. The first round, the markers are placed in the '5 position'. This means if the auction is stopped at this position, the winner pays 5 for the item. If no one stops the auction, players place a marker in the '4 position'. Once again, if the auction is stopped, the winner pays 4 for the item. These rounds continue until the auction is stopped, or until the auction moved to the last '0 position'. Once the auction for that item is complete, the deck passes to the next player. Each time the deck comes to a player, he collects income as listed on each item card he owns.

{"id":"645","name":"Bosworth","description":"Bosworth is essentially a chess variant for up to 4 players.  The pieces are the same as chess (8 pawns, 2 knights, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, a king, and a queen), but they are represented as disks so that they can be drawn randomly from a pile.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with 4 pawns in their edge of the board or &quot;field camps&quot; and four pieces from their draw pile as their hand.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player must move or capture with one piece, fill empty spaces in their field camp with a piece from their hand, and then draw to bring their hand up to four pieces.&#10;&#10;Pieces move and capture just like in chess, except for pawns, which can move sideways and capture in any diagonal direction, and kings, which can capture their own pieces to escape check.

{"id":"646","name":"Pirate's Plunder","description":"Pirate's Plunder is a card and dice game in which players take on the roles of pirates and engage in a life of swashbuckling adventure on the high seas.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns.  At the start of the game, each player starts off in a lifeboat.  They have to steal a pirate ship (based on the result of a dice roll), otherwise, they are stuck in the lifeboat and have to skip their turn.  When they have a ship, players draw Playing Cards into their hand.  These cards offer maps for treasures, events to modify a pirate's guns and crews, and other ways to bend the rules of the game.&#10;&#10;A pirate's score is reflected by his treasure, which comes from the wealth-laden ships, loot, and hostages in the form of Treasure Cards.  These cards are drawn from their deck when a pirate plays a map in hand, or by making a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll during their turn.  Pirates can bury their treasure to keep them safe, although they have to dig it up for it to be counted as score.&#10;&#10;Some Treasure Cards, however, are perils in the forms of deadly pirates (such as Blackbeard) and naval warships.  Players can play perils on fellow pirates, forcing them to engage in combat.  Players can also engage other players in battle as well during a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll if they choose to do so instead of drawing Treasure Cards.  Such battles are resolved by comparing dice rolls, which are added to the player's number of guns or crew.  The loser's ship is sunk and the player has to start his or her subsequent turns in a lifeboat.  The winner also takes the loser's unburied treasure.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a pirate has 3,000 or more pieces of eight worth of unburied treasure and makes a successful dice roll to &quot;Sail Home&quot;, thus becoming the winner.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_DIWvYnl1Wo6FLBUmvVs5g__thumb/img/5J4C8gUgfFg_PiMbb2Bbxwwi634=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic255082.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_DIWvYnl1Wo6FLBUmvVs5g__original/img/mJ2Qo54mfkSo--Kqz5yUf2emwbg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic255082.jpg","yearpublished":"2000","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":6,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":8,"publishers":["Hillary's Toy Box"],"designers":["Tray Green","Dawn Payn"],"artists":[],"rating":4.56311,"weight":1.5},

{"id":"651","name":"Zero Down","description":"How low can you go? In Zero, you want to score as few points as possible, but to do that you need to collect the right cards in hand.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 56 cards, with cards numbered 1-8 in seven colors. Each player starts with nine cards in hand, and five, seven or nine cards start face-up on the table depending on the number of players. On a turn, you either knock on the table to pass or you swap one card in hand for one card on the table. After the second knock, whether from the same player or a different one, all players other than the second knocker have one final chance to swap, after which they reveal and score their hands. If you have five or more cards of the same color or number in hand, then those cards score 0 points. For each other number you have, no matter how many copies, you score points equal to that card's value. Thus, having one to four 7s in hand is worth 7 points.&#10;&#10;If, however, you manage to collect both five cards of a color and five cards of a number in hand (with one card fitting in both sets), then you can declare &quot;Zero!&quot; and end the round immediately, with everyone else scoring points as usual.&#10;&#10;After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, whoever has the lowest score wins!&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3dI-B_5E8kTEIAXkx-Tp5A__thumb/img/pNUkHoVdohY3PpqmO19geuCfrko=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5371819.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3dI-B_5E8kTEIAXkx-Tp5A__original/img/K55SAxrC02fqez9DtUIFSyDFDbQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5371819.jpg","yearpublished":"1998","minplayers":2,"maxplayers":5,"minplaytime":20,"maxplaytime":"20","minage":8,"publishers":["ASYNCRON games","Berliner Spielkarten","Blue Orange Games","Educa Korea","Games 4 Gamers","HomoLudicus","Muduko","Outset Media","Pixie Games","„ÉÜ„É≥„Éá„Ç§„Ç∫„Ç≤„Éº„É†„Ç∫ (TendaysGames)","Trefl Joker Line","Zvezda"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"artists":[],"rating":6.48294,"weight":1.2364},

{"id":"653","name":"Shit!","description":"It is a game where everyone simultaneously plays a unique number face down card a la Take 5 (6 Nimmt).&#10;&#10;There are 5 suits arranged in a circular pattern. The idea is you score the points based on the first person to hit their number traveling clockwise after the current number, e.g. if the colors are Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, etc. and the current target card is Orange 6, then the first number after orange 6 wins a number of points equal to the interval. For example, orange 7 would win 1 point, but if it were not there and Green 1 were next closest, it would win 5 points. If the next closest card were orange 5 (unlikely but possible), it would score 49 points.&#10;&#10;Each player also always has in hand a Shit! card which cannot score, but playing it is the only way to get another card in hand. Strategy comes from watching when people play cards and how many they have left. Time it right and you can play while everyone else is drawing for monster points.&#10;&#10;It's a fun 20 minutes.

{"id":"657","name":"M√ºnchhausen","description":"A pure bluffing game. Each player gets a set of cards numbered 1 to 8 and a playing mat, which goes in front of him or her. The starting player is the Baron and the other players in turn offer him a card face down from their hand, stating the value. Each player must offer an equal or higher value card than the last and the Baron must take the highest card offered or choose between equal offers. The Baron must then decide to Accept or Reject the offer. If he accepts, the Baron puts the card face down on his mat and the turn passes to the next player. But if the Baron decides the player was lying and Rejects the offer, he turns the card over. If the offer was False, the player takes it back to their hand and the Baron gets to dump one of his cards onto his mat. But if it was True, The Baron must take the card into his hand and the player dumps a card face down. When a player's hand is empty, the game is over and you total the value of the cards on your mat, subtracting any left in your hand. Highest score wins. A simple game of pure bluff, it works incredibly well. Very funny and requires some thought. Baron Muenchausen is a famous character from German folklore, a notorious liar who lived a fantastical life. The game mats show illustrations and stories from his life in German, but this has nothing to do with the actual game play and non-German readers can play the game easily.&#10;&#10;","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qgvw-tuY09foUC6OfI7boQ__thumb/img/6GWEisBus9AYUzKwr2bcOCAlD-o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic877892.jpg","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qgvw-tuY09foUC6OfI7boQ__original/img/zWF8i5MisI9Nu7xqgpeBt9L8G6c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic877892.jpg","yearpublished":"1996","minplayers":3,"maxplayers":8,"minplaytime":30,"maxplaytime":"30","minage":8,"publishers":["ABACUSSPIELE"],"designers":["Thomas Schneider Axmann"],"artists":["Franz Vohwinkel"],"rating":5.87946,"weight":1.0833}]
